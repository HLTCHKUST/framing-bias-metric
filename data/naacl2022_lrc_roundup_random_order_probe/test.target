Arizona's teachers are already receiving vaccines this month and are expected to resume in-person teaching shortly, despite the state reaching its highest virus diagnosis rate in the past week.

The overhaul includes new restrictions on absentee voting, expanded access to in-person early voting, and gives the legislature greater control over how elections are run after a months-long debate over election laws in the battleground state. The 96-page bill alters Georgia's absentee voting rules by adding new identification requirements, requiring voters to submit ID information with both an absentee ballot request and the ballot itself. It also limits the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, allows unlimited challenges to a voter’s qualifications, shortens the runoff election period from nine to four weeks, and shortens the amount of time voters have to request an absentee ballot. The bill also gives the Republican-controlled state legislature the power to appoint a majority of members on the five-person state election board. This comes after the state saw record turnout in the November election and January US Senate runoffs, and received a record 1.3 million absentee ballots.

Ossoff's defeat of Perdue and Warnock's defeat of Loeffler were each decided by less than 100,000 votes. Georgia hasn't had a Democrat senator since 2000.

TITLE=> Lawmakers Disagree on Stimulus Changes; Vote Slated for Monday.

Democrats sought to increase the planned stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000 in agreement with a request from President Donald Trump, but GOP lawmakers blocked the request. Democrats then rejected Republican efforts to revisit foreign aid allocations in the bill, an attempt that appeased another request from Trump. The House will hold a recorded vote Monday to address the proposed stimulus check increase, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Without Trump's signature on the stimulus bill, millions of unemployed Americans will lose benefits Saturday when jobless benefit programs established earlier in the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic expire.

Schumer (D-N.Y.) complimented the deal on Sunday; Schumer said the aid package was "insufficient," but critical to “give the new president a boost, a head start, as he prepared to right our ailing economy.” Congress is set to vote on the package on Monday.

In his resignation letter, Foote said: “I will not be associated with the United States inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti, a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs to daily life.” State Department spokesman Ned Price criticized Foote, who was appointed in late July 2021, saying he had “resigned and mischaracterized” the situation instead of “participating in a solutions-oriented policy process.”

In December, Smartmatic sent Fox a letter demanding “a full and complete retraction of all false and defamatory statements and reports published by Fox News.” Fox responded by airing a short segment addressing misinformation about Smartmatic. Smartmatic's lawsuit comes after another Dominion also sued Giuliani and Powell for $1.3 billion. Fox News called the lawsuits "meritless" and says it plans to fight it in courts.

Some minimized the role that the administration was playing, focusing instead on other key actors and decisions.  One author, writing in the Wall Street Journal, described how outbreaks like this are almost always political in nature. Another author (rated Center), writing in MarketWatch, described how President Trump could lose his political base by pushing liberal policies in response to the crisis.
TITLE=> Yellen Urges Congress to Raise or Suspend Debt Ceiling. ARTICLE=> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to raise or suspend the debt ceiling as soon as possible on Wednesday, warning that inaction could lead to a historic default in October. “A delay that calls into question the federal government’s ability to meet all its obligations would likely cause irreparable damage to the U.S. economy and global financial markets,” Yellen said. The debt ceiling was suspended in 2019 until July 2021, and the Treasury has since taken “extraordinary measures” to raise funds without issuing new debt; Yellen said those measures will expire in October. While promising to explore multiple options to raise the debt ceiling, Pelosi said she would not include such legislation in Democrats' $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill. Thus, a debt ceiling bill could require the support of at least 10 Senate Republicans, at least 46 of whom have signed a pledge not to contribute to Democrats’ efforts to raise the cap.

ARTICLE=> Merrick Garland, President Joe Biden's nominee for attorney general, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday, where he vowed to guard the Justice Department from political influence and prioritize an investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol breach. Garland, a federal appeals court judge, managed the investigation into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and supervised the prosecution of the "Unabomber" Theodore Kaczynski. If appointed, Garland would inherit several cases from the previous administration, including a probe into Hunter Biden's taxes and John Durham's investigation of the origins of the probe into former President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. During questioning, Garland said he would allow Durham's investigation to continue, and promised to remain impartial in the investigation into Hunter Biden. Addressing a question from Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, Garland also said that Antifa’s attacks on a Portland courthouse last year may not have been “domestic terrorism,” because they took place at night when the court was not “in operation,” unlike the Capitol breach.
