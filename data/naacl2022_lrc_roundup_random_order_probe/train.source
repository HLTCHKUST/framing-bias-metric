ARTICLE=> The Democrat-controlled House on Thursday passed the Equality Act, sweeping legislation that would add sexual orientation and transgender status as protected classes under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

TITLE=> QAnon Believers Say Being Banned From Facebook Is Proof of the Conspiracy. ARTICLE=> QAnon followers were speculating on Tuesday night that Facebook’s new ban on all QAnon groups and pages was part of a complex plan by the Trump administration to root out the “deep state” and arrest their enemies. Or the social media company was trying to squelch the impending news that President Trump was about to crack down on his foes. QAnon believers were making both arguments. Neither was true. Earlier on Tuesday, Facebook announced it would remove any group, page or Instagram account associated with the QAnon conspiracy.

[SEP] TITLE=> Democrats: Amy Coney Barrett Will Strip Millions of Health Insurance. ARTICLE=> On Saturday, Democrats quickly criticized President Donald Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, arguing that her confirmation would put millions of Americans’ health insurance in jeopardy. In a statement, former Vice President Joe Biden focused on Coney Barrett’s “written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act.” Her criticism of the decision is particularly important because the court is scheduled to hear a major challenge to the healthcare law the week after the November election.
TITLE=> Fact Check: Chris Wallace Falsely Implies Trump Never Condemned White Supremacists. ARTICLE=> CLAIM: Debate moderator Chris Wallace implied that President Donald Trump never condemned white supremacists. VERDICT: FALSE. President Trump has done so repeatedly, despite what Wallace — and Joe Biden — have suggested. During the first presidential debate, Wallace challenged President Trump to condemn white supremacists.

I want to see peace.” Wallace pressed the question. [SEP] TITLE=> From Debate Stage, Trump Declines To Denounce White Supremacy.

During an exchange on the debate stage, moderator Chris Wallace repeatedly asked Trump if he would condemn white supremacists. Trump initially sidestepped that question, claiming that he mostly sees violence "from the left wing."

Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., one of the four freshman congresswomen known collectively as the “Squad,” is planning Tuesday to introduce a resolution seeking an impeachment inquiry into Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite reluctance from top Democrats to pursue one and concerns about the basis for the latest accusations.

ARTICLE=> A pair of Senate Republican committee chairmen released a report Wednesday arguing that Hunter Biden’s board position with a Ukrainian energy company was “awkward,” “problematic” and interfered with “efficient execution of policy” for the Obama administration, but failed to demonstrate that it changed the administration’s policy toward Ukraine.

TITLE=> U.S. House lawmakers secure enough votes to pass Trump impeachment rules. ARTICLE=> Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives secured enough votes on Thursday to pass legislation setting up next steps in the fast-moving impeachment process involving Republican President Donald Trump.

[SEP] TITLE=> House approves Trump impeachment procedures over GOP objections.

House Democrats are now expected to begin holding public hearings in the next few weeks to present testimony against Trump. [SEP] TITLE=> Vote shows Pelosi's impeachment inquiry more partisan than Clinton effort. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is already falling behind the 1998 GOP in her impeachment push after Thursday’s vote to launch an inquiry, where she was unable to win a single Republican’s support. The 232-196 vote even saw two Democrats side with the GOP against the effort, marking a stark break with 1998, the last time Congress pursued impeachment. In that instance 31 Democrats sided with all Republicans in a 257-176 vote launching an inquiry into President Clinton’s behavior.
TITLE=> Ruling By Senate Parliamentarian Opens Up Potential Pathway For Democrats. ARTICLE=> A new decision from the U.S. Senate's nonpartisan parliamentarian means Democrats could advance more of President Biden's agenda without the support of Republicans. The official's interpretation of Senate budget rules would allow the use of the reconciliation process more than once in a fiscal year, and it is viewed by Democrats as a possible strategy for moving top policy priorities with a simple majority, since getting the needed 10 Republican votes in a 50-50 Senate has proved difficult. [SEP] TITLE=> Senate Democrats can now officially pass more bills with 51 votes. ARTICLE=> Senate Democrats just got some wonky procedural news that has some pretty big implications for President Joe Biden’s agenda. On Monday night, the Senate parliamentarian — an in-house rules expert — determined that Democrats would be able to do a third budget reconciliation bill this year, a massive development that gives lawmakers more room to pass legislation without Republican support.

[SEP] TITLE=> Senate Dems Can Bypass GOP Filibuster on Two More Bills, Parliamentarian Rules. ARTICLE=> The Senate parliamentarian has ruled that Democrats can pass two more pieces of legislation via budget reconciliation procedures, bypassing a potential filibuster by Republicans. The ruling allows Democrats to pass two bills with a simple majority instead of the usual 60-vote threshold required in the Senate.

The process was previously used to pass Democrats’ coronavirus relief bill.

ARTICLE=> In recent weeks, as protests against police violence have spread nationwide in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, TV critics and others who cover the medium have raised a frequent refrain: Cancel all the cop shows.

Their alternative: a model called Focused Protection, outlined in their Great Barrington Declaration, which would reopen society and allow young people to live their lives normally while implementing safeguards for the elderly.

ARTICLE=> President Biden is expected to announce the American Families Plan during his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday that has been framed as a complement to earlier massive investments during the COVID-19 era, but critics will likely seize on the plan as an attempt to extend major parts of the earlier relief packages.

Worker filings for jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, fell 92,000 last week from 590,000 the prior week. That brings the four-week average of initial claims, which smooths out volatility in weekly data, to the lowest point since the pandemic took hold, though still well above pre-pandemic levels.
TITLE=> Fauci: You Have the Private Sector To Thank For Wuhan Coronavirus Tests, Not the Gov't 'System'. ARTICLE=> The government “system” could not hold a candle to the private sector on coronavirus testing, Dr. Anthony Fauci explained Thursday during an Instagram story interview with NBA star Steph Curry, which is why the U.S. has seen a drastic uptick in accurate and widespread test kits available. “We have hundreds of thousands of tests that are out there now, mostly because we got the private sector involved, of the companies who know how to make it well, make large amounts,” Fauci told the Golden State Warriors player.

ARTICLE=> President Trump gave the United States a pat on the back on this week, saying the nation had done more coronavirus testing than South Korea, a country widely seen as a model in its management of the pandemic.

ARTICLE=> The United States has found its first cases of a potent coronavirus variant first detected in South Africa, health officials in the state of South Carolina said on Thursday. Viruses mutate frequently, and several mutated viruses have been identified. The presence of the South African variant in the United States is especially concerning because several laboratory studies have shown that it reduces vaccine effectiveness. Another concern, according to the nominee for U.S. surgeon general, is that the South African variant could require larger doses of antibody for treatment. [SEP] TITLE=> Novavax COVID vaccine highly effective — except against South African strain.

Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, certified that Mr. Biden won the state by 0.3 percentage points, or 10,457 votes.
TITLE=> Busing is still happening. And 2020 Democrats are divided on what to about it.. ARTICLE=> Kamala Harris’s broadside against Joe Biden’s record on busing during last week’s Democratic presidential debate has done more than just re-energize the California senator’s presidential campaign.

[SEP] TITLE=> Desegregating schools without busing. ARTICLE=> The failures of busing were widely recognized even on the left not too long ago.

It wasn’t. [SEP] TITLE=> What Kamala Harris And Joe Biden Should Be Talking About Instead Of Busing. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden is getting flak for his stance on busing. But segregated schools aren’t the root cause of educational inequity, and integration alone isn’t enough to address it. At the Democratic Presidential debate last week, Kamala Harris took on Joe Biden for his opposition to court-ordered busing. At the debate, Biden defended his position with what sounded like a reference to states’ rights, a phrase that has historically served as a cover for racism.

But a soft ADP report Wednesday, with just 102,000 new private payrolls dampened expectations for the government’s June payroll report, which will be released Friday.

[SEP] TITLE=> Why Trump is right in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. ARTICLE=> President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital is a perfect response to President Obama’s benighted decision to change American policy by engineering the United Nations Security Council Resolution declaring Judaism’s holiest places in Jerusalem to be occupied territory and a “flagrant violation under international law.” It was President Obama who changed the status quo and made peace more difficult, by handing the Palestinians enormous leverage in future negotiations and disincentivizing them from making a compromised peace.

[SEP] TITLE=> Biden launches federal effort to respond to Texas law as he faces pressure to protect abortion. ARTICLE=> A new Texas law that effectively bans most abortions prompted President Joe Biden on Wednesday to use a word he'd entirely avoided as president: "Abortion." The absence of the word in Biden's public remarks and statements has frustrated activists, who say it reflects an issue that fell off the priority list even as women's right to an abortion comes under threat in states across the Midwest and South. The Supreme Court on Wednesday night formally denied a request from Texas abortion providers to freeze the state law, meaning it will remain on the books for now.
