Here’s a range of op-eds written by people from throughout the political spectrum, making various cases for why you should (or shouldn’t) vote for either President Donald Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

We’ve learned that the CDC is making, at best, a debilitating mistake: combining test results that diagnose current coronavirus infections with test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus. The upshot is that the government’s disease-fighting agency is overstating the country’s ability to test people who are sick with COVID-19. [SEP] TITLE=> A Fundamental Flub From The CDC. ARTICLE=> After two months lived under the threat of coronavirus, the key characteristic of the crisis remains uncertainty. We don’t know where the virus came from.

ARTICLE=> Mike Pence has promoted an unsubstantiated theory linking the 9/11 terrorist attacks to Iran in his defence of the Trump administration’s assassination of Qassem Soleimani. Donald Trump’s vice president posted a Twitter thread on Saturday in which he described Iran’s top military commander as “an evil man responsible for killing thousands of Americans”. In the thread, Mr Pence claimed Soleimani had “assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States”. [SEP] TITLE=> Iran proved vital to al Qaeda's safe passage, according to bin Laden records, 9/11 commission. ARTICLE=> Iran “facilitated” the movement of al Qaeda terrorists through its country, including September 11, 2001 attackers and for years was a critical channel for money and arms, according to the 9-11 commission report and internal Osama bin Laden documents. Experts say the late Qassem Soleimani surely knew of and directed the terror partnership since he has headed since 1998 Iran’s Quds Force. It is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization and an arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps which dominates Iranian society. [SEP] TITLE=> Reality check: Mike Pence links Soleimani to 9/11.

[SEP] TITLE=> FactChecking the Final 2020 Presidential Debate. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden faced off in the final presidential debate of the campaign. We found: Trump accused Biden of receiving “$3.5 million from Russia.” There’s no evidence of that. Biden said there’s “no evidence” that raising the minimum wage causes business bankruptcies. There is, a little. Trump erred when he said it’s “proven” that a minimum-wage boost would lead to many firings. There’s a chance that the effect could be “about zero,” according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden Lies Again and Again. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden is a career liar and he lied some more in the debate, for instance when he dismissed the now well-supported New York Post story about Hunter Biden’s business dealing as “a Russian plant.” There is zero evidence for this. He offered this line: There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. Five former heads of the CIA — both parties — say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage.

TITLE=> CNN Implicitly Took Elizabeth Warren's Side in the Unproven Sexism Accusation Against Bernie Sanders. ARTICLE=> Diehard supports of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) have long believed that the mainstream media finds subtle ways to undermine their candidate—and occasionally their suspicions are well supported.

TITLE=> Why tech companies failed to keep the New Zealand shooter’s extremism from going viral. ARTICLE=> Friday’s massacre exemplified the problem of expecting tech companies to self-police content. The hate-filled terror rampage at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, was meticulously designed to maximize the number of witnesses around the globe, highlighting the difficulty in putting a lid on extremist hate that spreads online.

TITLE=> The Senate’s return is a test case for the House. ARTICLE=> If Congress returns too soon and lawmakers contract coronavirus, leaders could face backlash for not keeping members safe. But if Congress doesn’t get back to business, leaders could take heat for sitting on the sidelines in the middle of a crisis. Those are the competing pressures that the Senate and House are under as they make decisions about when — and how — to reopen. So far, the chambers are taking divergent approaches. [SEP] TITLE=> Kevin McCarthy, House Republicans lay out priorities for reopening Congress. ARTICLE=> House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and several top Republicans on Monday laid out a set of proposals for members to follow when the full chamber does return to Washington, D.C., amid the coronavirus pandemic.

TITLE=> Is Unemployment Bonus Keeping Workers on Sideline?. ARTICLE=> Despite a stubbornly high unemployment rate of 6.1% in April — representing 9.8 million people who say they are actively looking for work — many employers are reporting that they can’t find people to hire. Republicans say the $300 a week supplement to unemployment insurance, which for many Americans amounts to a pay raise, is so generous that it is acting as a disincentive for people to return to work. [SEP] TITLE=> Job openings soar to record high 9.3 million, raising fears of labor shortage. ARTICLE=> Job openings soared to a record high at the end of April, the labor Labor Department said Tuesday, adding to fears about unfulfilled demand for workers.

ARTICLE=> The U.S. economy grew at a record-breaking 33.1% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, beating forecasters' expectations. The massive growth number, although not enough to return the economy to pre-pandemic health, will provide President Trump to claim in the last days of the election that the country is clawing its way out of the COVID-19 recession faster than critics thought possible. [SEP] TITLE=> U.S. Economy Recovered Significant Ground in Record Third-Quarter GDP Rebound. ARTICLE=> The economy grew at a record pace in the third quarter—increasing 7.4% over the prior quarter and at a 33.1% annual rate—recovering about two-thirds of the ground it lost earlier in the coronavirus pandemic. Gross domestic product—the value of all goods and services produced across the economy—jumped following a record decline from earlier in the pandemic when the virus and related shutdowns disrupted business activity across the country. That puts the economy about 3.5% smaller than at the end of last year, adjusted for inflation and seasonal fluctuations.

ARTICLE=> The US economy in the summer recovered much of the historically enormous ground it lost in the spring, expanding at the fastest rate on record in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

The third quarter, however, was one for the record books.

Congressional Democrats continued their talks with the Trump administration on Thursday on whether there's a deal that can pass Congress unanimously. Without additional funding, banks and the Small Business Administration will be unable to approve more of the Paycheck Protection Program loans designed to avert layoffs during the coronavirus pandemic, which can be forgiven if businesses agree to maintain their payrolls. [SEP] TITLE=> Small business lending program on hold after reaching limit. ARTICLE=> NEW YORK (AP) — The government’s lending program for small businesses is on hold. The Small Business Administration said Thursday that it reached the $349 billion lending limit for the program, after approving nearly 1.7 million loans.

In the past week alone, American Airlines and computer company Dell came out strongly against GOP-led bills that place restrictions on voting in their home base of Texas. South Dakota Gov.

ARTICLE=> BEIJING — President Trump imposed tariffs in July on $34 billion in Chinese goods. China matched them dollar for dollar with its own.

TITLE=> OPINION: Ending Birthright Citizenship Is No Panacea. ARTICLE=> According to Axios, President Trump is gearing up to sign an executive order that would, in their words, “remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens born on U.S. soil.” There is some ambiguity in this formulation.

TITLE=> Trump says ‘no money’ paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier. ARTICLE=> President Trump on Friday said “no money” was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, after reports that the U.S. received a $2 million hospital bill from Pyongyang for the late American prisoner’s care. “No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else. This is not the Obama Administration that paid 1.8 Billion Dollars for four hostages, or gave five terroist[sic] hostages plus, who soon went back to battle, for traitor Sgt. Bergdahl!” Trump tweeted Friday. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump says U.S. did not pay any of the $2 million that North Korea sought for Otto Warmbier’s care.

[SEP] TITLE=> Trump denies paying North Korea for Warmbier treatment. ARTICLE=> President Trump has denied paying North Korea money for the medical care of comatose US student Otto Warmbier.

In Dixville Notch, a surprise candidate came away the winner. [SEP] TITLE=> Everything You Need To Know About The New Hampshire Primary. ARTICLE=> Democrats are going to try again. After the Iowa results meltdown, New Hampshire takes center stage Tuesday night. This election is run by the secretary of state's office and not the state party. It's also a more-straightforward primary (with a couple kinks we explain below) rather than a complicated, math-heavy caucus. There is lots at stake, as New Hampshire has served to reinforce or reset the Democratic primary race over the last five decades. [SEP] TITLE=> Sanders may be on the verge of another New Hampshire win. Democrats aren't ready to get behind him.. ARTICLE=> Bernie Sanders has been running for president a very long time. Long enough to get nostalgic. “Four years ago, I came to New Hampshire and I had a series of proposals that the political establishment said was very radical, too extreme,” Sanders told a crowd at Franklin Pierce University on Monday.

[SEP] TITLE=> Republican Defections May Have Just Ended Herman Cain's Federal Reserve Nomination. ARTICLE=> President Trump has nominated Herman Cain and Stephen Moore to the Federal Reserve board, choices that Nancy Pelosi called "ill-suited," "embarrassing," and "the worst." Cain, the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO, became synonymous with his famous tagline, "9-9-9," when he was running for president in 2012. That is, a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent corporate tax, and a 9 percent national sales tax. He told voters he'd implement the plan in his first 90 days as president.

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that Cuccinelli's appointment as the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) circumvented a law that said a senior government position could be filled only if the Senate first approved the individual. It was not immediately clear what impact this would have on Cuccinelli's tenure, if any. [SEP] TITLE=> Judge rules Cuccinelli unlawfully appointed to run immigration agency.

The 17-year-old accused killer dedicated his social media to his two obsessions, right from the cover of his now-deleted Facebook profile that had him posing with a high-powered rifle. “Duty. Honor.

Videos of the event tell us an incomplete story of what, exactly, happened that night.
