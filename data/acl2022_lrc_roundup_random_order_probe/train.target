TITLE=> World Leaders React To US-UK-Australia Nuclear Submarine Deal. ARTICLE=> The new security partnership between the US, UK and Australia — titled "AUKUS" — has sparked backlash from various world leaders who feel compromised by the alliance. Announced by President Joe Biden on Wednesday, the alliance between the three English-speaking nations is meant to strengthen their security interests through cooperation on defense technology. AUKUS' first major initiative will be to supply Australia with a new nuclear-powered submarine fleet, resulting in the cancellation of Australia's $90 billion deal with France to build submarines. Describing the partnership as “treason in the making,” French ambassador Jean-Pierre Thebault said on Saturday that Australia has made a “huge mistake” that showcased “unacceptable behavior between allies and partners.” The French Embassy also canceled an event that would have recognized the 240th anniversary of a Revolutionary War battle, an event that symbolized strong cooperation between the U.S. and France. While Australia is not looking to develop its own nuclear weapons, New Zealand was absent from the deal due to its nuclear-free policy; Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stated Thursday that Australia's nuclear submarines will be banned from New Zealand waters. Most stories across the spectrum noted how the AUKUS partnership has "aggravated already tense relations" with China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called on the alliance to abandon their "outdated Cold War zero-sum mentality and narrow-minded geopolitical stability," indicating that their deal has "intensified the arms race."
TITLE=> White House to Develop COVID-19 'Vaccine Passports'.

Several government agencies, including the offices of Health and Human Services, are coordinating with technology and travel companies, to develop the vaccine passport system, CNN reported Sunday. The vaccine passports could potentially be required for  travel, live entertainment and sporting events and dining out, as a growing number of businesses say they will require proof of vaccination before reopening. The passports are expected to be free and available through smartphone applications, which could display a scannable code; those without smartphone access should be able to print out the passports, according to developers. This comes as the European Union pledged to release digital certificates that would allow for travel by summer, and as a digital pass developed by IBM is being tested in New York.

The comments come a day after McCarthy pulled GOP nominees to the committee in retaliation for Pelosi’s rejection of Reps. Jim Banks and Jim Jordan. Rep. Liz Cheney, who is now the sole Republican appointed to the committee, also criticized McCarthy on Thursday, saying that his “playing politics” was “disgraceful.” Pelosi is reportedly considering appointing Republican Trump critic Rep.

TITLE=> US Shoots Down Rockets Aimed at Kabul Airport. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the U.S. military reportedly shot down as many as five rockets that were aimed at the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. A counter-rocket system called C-RAM was used to bring down the rockets before they reached their target.

The Pentagon also said it used a drone strike Sunday to eliminate an airport-bound vehicle filled with explosives; the drone strike also led to civilian casualties. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the rockets, though U.S. officials suspect it was the Islamic terror group ISIS-K.  ISIS-K was responsible for the suicide bombing in Kabul that killed more than 170 people, including 13 American service members.

Wade. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, questions the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi law which banned abortions after 15 weeks. A federal judge struck down the law later that year, ruling that it conflicted with Roe v. Wade’s precedent that abortion could not be banned before “viability,” or the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth. The review, which was requested by Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, will be held after the Supreme Court’s summer recess and will focus on the question of “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.”

TITLE=> CDC Recommends Vaccinated People Wear Masks Indoors in High Transmission Areas. ARTICLE=> The Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday recommended that vaccinated people in areas with “substantial or high” COVID-19 transmission wear masks in public indoor settings. As of Tuesday, 46% of U.S. counties had “high transmission” and 17% had “substantial transmission,” including most counties in most Southern and Western states; every county in Arkansas, Florida and Louisiana had high transmission on Tuesday. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the change came after new research showed that vaccinated people with rare “breakthrough” infections could spread the virus as easily as the unvaccinated. The CDC also recommended on Tuesday that K-12 students, teachers and staff wear masks indoors when they return to in-person school, regardless of vaccination status. The CDC previously said in May that vaccinated people no longer needed to wear masks in most indoor settings. However, a surge in cases of the more transmissible Delta variant has led many states to see thousands of new cases per day, mainly among the unvaccinated.

Politico (lean Left bias) reported that Trump reacted to Friday's ruling, calling it "an insult to the record-setting 75M people, plus many others, who voted for us in the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election."

ARTICLE=> The World Health Organization on Wednesday called for a moratorium on COVID-19 vaccine booster shots until at least the end of September to give all countries the chance to vaccinate at least 10% of their populations with at least one dose. The same day, the world saw its 200 millionth detected case of COVID-19, as countries with low vaccination rates continued to struggle under the pandemic.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained the move, saying, “So far, more than 4 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally. More than 80% have gone to high- and upper-middle income countries, even though they account for less than half of the world’s population. I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected.”

TITLE=> Concerns About New Domestic Terrorism Laws Come from Multiple Angles.

A bill was also introduced in the House last week aiming to "authorize dedicated domestic terrorism offices" within government institutions. Others soon spoke out against expanding federal national security powers. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said new domestic terror laws would jeopardize civil rights and minority groups, and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said more federal security powers would create an oligarchy and endanger personal freedoms. Government attention to the issue isn't all new; in 2019, Rep.

Among the dead are 13 U.S. service members and more than 100 Afghans; it's the deadliest incident for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since 2011. Earlier Thursday, the U.S. and other nations had warned of possible terrorist attacks near the airport due to threats from Islamic militants. The Pentagon has blamed Islamic terror groups for the attacks; the Islamic State claimed responsibility Thursday afternoon. The airport is the epicenter of a massive evacuation effort as thousands flee the country amid the Taliban's return to power. On Thursday evening, President Joe Biden promised retaliation against ISIS-K, the regional affiliate of the Islamic State responsible for the attack, saying, “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.” Biden added that this retaliation would not interfere with the Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline. On Friday, military officials said that only one explosion happened near the airport Thursday; two separate explosions were initially reported by sources across the spectrum.

ARTICLE=> On Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government in a lawsuit by an environmental group that sued the Obama administration in 2015 for internal studies detailing potential harm to endangered aquatic species, in the first major opinion penned by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The Sierra Club argued that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to disclose studies about the impact of an Environmental Protection Agency rule detailing how power plants draw water to cool down machinery. Barrett's opinion, which was joined by the five other conservative justices as well as Justice Elena Kagan, said government agencies were protected from FOIA inquires because of the "deliberative process privilege," which means draft documents can be withheld from public view. The case was the first time Barrett took part in oral arguments since she was appointed to the Supreme Court last fall by former President Donald Trump to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor dissented; Breyer wrote that he viewed the "Draft Biological Opinion" as a "final" document, as opposed to "Draft of a Draft Biological Opinion."

The Senate voted 50-50 to advance the bill with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie; no Republicans voted to take up the bill. This comes after a delay in approval from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which would make sure the Senate's bill complied with reconciliation rules -- a budget process that allows the bill to bypass a 60-vote filibuster. The Senate's version of the bill removes the $15 minimum wage increase, and lowers the cutoff for receiving stimulus checks to $80,000 for individuals and $160,000 for couples. The Senate will likely debate the bill for several days before it reaches a final vote. Then, the bill will return to the House, which will need to approve any changes made by the Senate.

She said the Treasury "would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly” if that deadline isn't reached, warning that it's “uncertain whether we could continue to meet all the nation’s commitments after that date.” America would default on the national debt for the first time in history, which Yellen said would lead to "a financial crisis and economic recession." Yellen’s letter was sent just hours after Senate Republicans on Monday voted against a measure to suspend the debt ceiling, arguing that it would enable more purportedly reckless spending from Democrats. The Bipartisan Policy Center recently estimated that the Treasury will run out of cash between Oct. 15 and Nov. 4; a report from Moody’s Analytics said a default could cause 6 million lost jobs and $15 trillion of lost household wealth.

While the move drew criticism from progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ilhan Omar, the White House reportedly does not plan to challenge the ruling.

Kennedy Jr. — four individuals that the Center for Countering Digital Hate has affiliated with "The Disinformation Dozen" — for purportedly playing leading roles in spreading COVID-19 vaccine misinformation online. Certain countries such as Russia have pushed back against YouTube's restrictions, threatening to block the video platform altogether unless they revive two German-language channels ran by their state media company RT that were deleted after sharing what YouTube dubbed as COVID-19 misinformation.

The bill would require new forms of voter identification for mail-in voting and prohibit drive-thru voting and overnight early voting. Supporters of the bill say it would enhance election integrity and security; those who oppose the bill say it would restrict voter access in marginalized communities.

The disruptions continued into Monday with over 360 cancellations and 1,300 delays. Other airlines were not as severely impacted by these issues; airlines such as American and Spirit canceled 2% of flights over the holiday weekend. The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) on Friday filed a motion to temporarily block the airline's COVID-19 vaccine mandate until an ongoing lawsuit over alleged U.S. labor law violations is resolved; the airline emphasized that the matter won't "require negotiation" moving forward.

TITLE=> Top FDA and WHO Scientists Call COVID-19 Booster Shots Unnecessary For Most Americans At This Time. ARTICLE=> An international group of scientists published a paper Monday that suggests more scientific evidence is needed to justify giving booster shots to most Americans at this time. Co-authors included Marion Gruber and Phil Krause, two senior FDA officials who are leaving the organization later this fall over frustrations with the Biden administration’s "premature" booster plan, along with several scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO). The report concludes that vaccine "efficacy against severe disease remains high" except for individuals with compromised immune systems, and highlights how "the unvaccinated are still the major drivers of transmission" during this stage of the pandemic. WHO scientists argued that the U.S. should prioritize giving doses to countries with low vaccination rates to reduce the risk of serious illness and emerging variants. The paper also emphasized the importance of creating "clear public health messaging before boosting" to mitigate vaccine hesitancy. While the CDC and FDA advised the White House to slow down its vaccine booster plan earlier this month, the Biden administration has yet to delay its plans to begin widely offering the third shots on Sept. 20. The FDA will meet with an outside panel of experts on Sept. 17 to further review the Pfizer/BioNTech booster shot.

TITLE=> Twitter Permanently Suspends Project Veritas Account. ARTICLE=> Twitter permanently suspended Project Veritas' account on Thursday, citing violations of Twitter's policies against publishing private information. According to Project Veritas, the ban comes after Project Veritas posted a video of Facebook Vice President of Integrity Guy Rosen speaking to Project Veritas reporter Christian Hartsock outside of his home. Hartstock asked Rosen about comments he made in a recently leaked internal Facebook meeting where Rosen said there is “a system that is able to freeze commenting” when there could be “hate speech.” A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to The Hill that the main Project Veritas account was permanently suspended, while founder James O'Keefe had his account temporarily locked, though Twitter declined to say what specific tweets or information triggered the ban. Several recent tweets on O'Keefe's timeline also appeared to have been deleted. In a post on Project Veritas's public Telegram channel Thursday afternoon, the group said it is appealing this decision, claiming no privacy was violated, that that the reporter on the ground never revealed the location, and that no street signs that would indicate the location were visible in the video. On Jan. 8, Project Veritas leaked a call in which Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said his company would be ramping up censorship.

Of that group, Blinken said the State Department was in “direct contact” with about 500 and “aggressively reaching out” to the remaining 1,000 “multiple times a day through multiple channels of communication.” About 6,000 Americans were in the country when the Taliban took Kabul on Aug. 14, Blinken said, and about 4,500 of the 82,300 people evacuated by the U.S. had American passports. The new figures came less than a week before President Joe Biden’s Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, but Blinken stressed that evacuation efforts would continue for both Americans and Afghan allies, saying, “That effort will continue every day past August 31.”

TITLE=> Supreme Court Hears High School Student's Free Speech Case. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments for a case which could impact free speech for American public school students. The case, Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L, centers around a then-high school sophomore who tried out for her school’s varsity cheerleading squad and didn’t make the team; soon after, the student posted an image of herself and a friend holding up their middle fingers to Snapchat, with an expletive-heavy caption. As punishment, the school's cheer coaches suspended the student from the cheerleading team for one year. The Pennsylvania school, backed by the Biden administration, argued the Supreme Court should allow schools to regulate students speech on social media when it becomes disruptive. American Civil Liberties Union lawyer David Cole, representing the student, argued educators should have no authority over student speech when they are not under a school’s supervision. The case could clarify the limits of the 1969 Supreme Court precedent that allows public schools to punish student speech when it "substantially disrupts" school. A decision is expected by June.

The race is key in determining which party will control the Senate during Biden's upcoming term. Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are running for the seats of Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Purdue.

More than 3 million Georgia residents have already cast early votes, a record for the state's runoff elections. 
TITLE=> Biden's Supreme Court Commission Raises Concerns About Adding Justices. ARTICLE=> A commission formed by President Joe Biden to study potential changes to the Supreme Court has raised concerns about increasing the number of justices. Preliminary draft materials released on Thursday contained warnings from some members that feared the "partisan maneuver" would “undermine, rather than enhance” the Supreme Court's legitimacy. The bipartisan commission met Friday to assess term limits for justices, limiting the number of justices that a president can name, and whether expanding the Supreme Court would be "wise." Progressive Democrats who have pushed to expand the number of seats said that the draft "misses the mark," alleging that the group is "biased" against court-packing. Biden formed the 36-member commission in April in order to receive “analysis and appraisal” from both sides of the current debate over the Supreme Court. He will receive a final report from the commission in mid-November.

Projected 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden is expected to fully restore DACA . 
TITLE=> Japan Restarts Commercial Whaling After Decades. ARTICLE=> After three decades, Japan has resumed its commercial whaling program. Last year, Japan withdrew from the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which banned whale hunting, but the country was granted an exemption for research purposes. Conservationists argue that whale hunts Japan claimed were scientific in nature were actually commercial hunts in disguise. While Japan is well known for commercial whaling, many Norwegians and Icelanders also say whale hunting is an important part of their culture and should not be banned. Some commentators have questioned whether the current Japanese market still has the same demand for whale meat as it did 30 years ago, while pointing out that much of the world has condemned whaling as a practice. Voices across the political spectrum point out that while commercial whaling openly defies the IWC ban, the whales Japan will hunt are not considered endangered or threatened in the U.S. by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Japan has continued whaling for what it claims are scientific purposes since a worldwide moratorium was placed on whaling in 1986.

After her initial tweet, Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.) and other Jewish House Democrats issued a statement urging Omar to clarify her statements, to which Omar replied that her colleagues' "Islamophobic tropes," "harrassment" and "silencing" were "offensive" and "unbearable." On Thursday morning, however, Omar stated her comments were directed toward ongoing International Criminal Court probes, and that she "was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well-established judicial systems." On Thursday, Pelosi and her team stated that while "legitimate criticism" of U.S. policies is protected by free speech, "drawing false equivalencies between democracies like the U.S. and Israel and groups that engage in terrorism like Hamas and the Taliban foments prejudice and undermines progress toward a future of peace and security for all." The statement also said that the team "welcome the clarification" from Omar that there is no moral equivalency between the U.S. and Israel and Hamas and the Taliban.

TITLE=> House Passes Resolution Formalizing Impeachment Probe. ARTICLE=> The House, in a 232 to 196 vote Thursday morning, approved a resolution formalizing an impeachment probe.

Democrats remained adamant that the probe is constitutionally necessary; Speaker Nancy Pelosi also characterized the day as "sad".
TITLE=> Senate Parliamentarian Allows Democrats to Bypass Republican Filibuster on Two Bills. ARTICLE=> On Monday, Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled that Democrats can pass two more bills without Republican support by using the budget reconciliation process once again this fiscal year. This allows Democrats to pass two budget-related bills with a simple majority instead of the usual 60-vote threshold requirement. Democrats have already passed two reconciliation bills, with one focused on fiscal year 2021 and one focused on fiscal year 2022. The decision comes from MacDonough’s interpretation of Section 304 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which states lawmakers may revise a budget resolution before the end of the fiscal year that it covers. The ruling now allows Democrats to edit the 2021 budget resolution they already passed, and include instructions for another bill. A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that “no decisions have been made on a legislative path forward using Section 304 and some parameters still need to be worked out.”While details of Democrats' plan for this additional opportunity have yet to be released, many speculate it will be used to approve President Joe Biden's multi-trillion dollar infrastructure plan, which is split into two bills.

TITLE=> Texas Governor Signs 'Heartbeat Bill' Banning Abortion. ARTICLE=> Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill Wednesday banning abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat. The bill, passed by both chambers of the Republican-majority Texas legislature, prohibits abortion at six weeks of pregnancy without making an exception for rape or incest, though it does make an exception for medical emergencies. While approximately a dozen states have passed similar "heartbeat" bills, the Texas version absolves the state from enforcing the law and instead includes a provision that allows citizens to sue anyone they believe to be involved in helping a pregnant individual violate the ban. While the provision cannot be used against pregnant people, reproductive rights advocates warn it can be used against abortion providers and reproductive rights activists. The bill is expected to take effect in September. This comes after the Supreme Court announced Monday it would review a major abortion dispute that could roll back abortion protections under Roe v. Wade. Coverage across the political spectrum tended to focus on the details of the bill. Some coverage from the center and left tended to frame the ban as "extreme" and highlight that at six weeks, Texas' bill has the earliest threshold for the ban, as many people are not aware they are pregnant by then. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight Abbott's remarks and the provision for private lawsuits.

ARTICLE=> A proposal from Dr. Martin Kulldorff of Harvard, Dr. Sunetra Gupta of Oxford, and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford — titled the Great Barrington Declaration — seeks to end COVID-19 coronavirus lockdowns and reopen society. The plan focuses on "herd immunity," in which people would purportedly build immunity to the coronavirus without a vaccine; the authors argue lockdowns "are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health." Dr. Anthony Fauci and other public health experts have dismissed the idea; when asked about the plan at his NBC town hall Thursday, President Donald Trump said in part, "the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself."
TITLE=> Congress Certifies Biden Win, Trump Promises "Orderly Transition". ARTICLE=> Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden's victory shortly before 4:00 a.m. ET Thursday.

Prosecutors did not link Khater and Tanios' attack with Sicknick's death the following day, as the cause of Sicknick's death is still publicly unknown. The Washington Post reported that officials disputed early reporting that Sicknick was killed by blunt force trauma. Capitol police said in a statement on Feb. 26 that the investigation into Sicknick's death is ongoing.

The majority of the court agreed that "...It is up to Congress, not the CDC, to decide whether the public interest merits further action here." White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that the White House is disappointed by the ruling and calls on "cities and states, local courts, landlords, Cabinet agencies...to urgently act to prevent evictions." The high court's decision stemmed from a legal challenge to the extension mounted by landlords and real estate groups.

TITLE=> CNN Files Lawsuit Against White House Over Jim Acosta's Press Credentials. ARTICLE=> CNN has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for suspending Jim Acosta's press credentials, alleging the move violates the First Amendment. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders responded by saying Acosta's "attempts to monopolize the floor" cost him his pass, after initially saying it was because he pushed an intern, a claim that was widely debunked. Experts are divided over who has the stronger case: some say it was a clear violation of free speech, arguing that Trump retaliated against Acosta over the content of his questions, while others contend it was Acosta's behavior that cost him his pass and that CNN has other reporters who can cover the White House.

TITLE=> Israel, Hamas Agree to A Ceasefire In Truce Brokered By Egypt.

Ron DeSantis signed a law Thursday morning that places tighter limits on ballot drop boxes and voting by mail. "I have what we think is the strongest election integrity measures in the country," DeSantis said. The law, which bears some similarities to Georgia’s recent controversial voting law, was passed by Florida Republicans on near party-line votes and over the opposition of Florida’s county supervisors of elections. Specifically, the law requires an ID number to request a mail-in ballot, lowers the applicability of mail-in ballot requests from 4 years to 2, and limits drop boxes to in-person monitored locations during regular early voting hours, among other things. DeSantis, accompanied by the pro-Trump group Club 45 USA, signed the law live on Fox News and shut out local media. Democrats and civil rights groups promptly filed two lawsuits challenging the new law.

Trump highlighted his administration’s “Operation Warp Speed,” a public-private partnership, saying the project had "three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now." Some fact checkers report that Trump cannot guarantee that the project will develop a successful vaccine by the end of the year. Of the four vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States, the one from Moderna is furthest along; the U.S. also recently approved the use of convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19, but currently there’s no clear proof the plasma treatment saves lives.
TITLE=> Top DoD Official to Step Down, Says He Was Asked to Resign. ARTICLE=> Undersecretary of defense John Rood, the Pentagon's top-ranking policy official, will reportedly resign effective February 28.

Rood's letter says Defense Secretary Mark Esper notified him of Trump's apparent intention to have him resign. The Pentagon confirmed the move in a statement Wednesday after details of Rood's resignation letter were made public; Rood was reportedly key in approving a controversial foreign aid package to Ukraine last year that eventually became the focus of Trump's impeachment.

Senator Ed Markey, and Reps. Jerry Nadler, Hank Johnson and Mondaire Jones will hold a press conference to introduce the bill Thursday on the steps of the Supreme Court.

This initiative comes after Biden last week signed an executive order establishing a bipartisan commission to look into possible changes to the Supreme Court’s membership, jurisdiction and lifetime terms and report back in six months. The move reflects a battle over the future of the court after former President Donald Trump appointed three conservative justices in four years, while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denied a vote in 2016 to former President Barack Obama's pick to fill a vacancy, citing an election year.

French leaders said Thursday that they were not consulted on the deal, which effectively ended France’s multi-billion dollar 2016 deal to sell less sophisticated submarines to Australia. As a result, France canceled an upcoming gala to honor French-U.S. relations, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a statement calling France a “vital partner” in “transatlantic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the U.S. and U.K. had a “cold war mentality” and were “applying double standards, which is extremely irresponsible.”

The platform also introduced a strike system for accounts that repeatedly violate the rules; one strike is a warning, second and third strikes result in a 12-hour account lock, a fourth strike is a weeklong lock on the account, and five strikes results in permanent suspension. This comes after Twitter decided to remove posts containing “the most harmful misleading information” about coronavirus vaccines in December. According to Twitter, the policy will remove tweets which "advance harmful false or misleading narratives about COVID-19 vaccinations." The Washington Examiner reported that since introducing the policy in December, Twitter has removed more than 8,400 tweets and challenged 11.5 million accounts worldwide. Initially, labels will initially be enforced by Twitter team members only, which will help automated systems pick up on violating content; eventually, Twitter will use both automated and human review to flag misleading information. 
TITLE=> FDA Authorizes Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine for Emergency Use. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it approved Pfizer's COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine on Friday evening, with inoculations expected to begin as early as Monday.

ARTICLE=> The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday that the Consumer Price Index, which economists use to measure inflation, rose 0.8% in April and 0.6% in March, marking a 4.2% 12-month increase. This was the largest monthly increase since 2009 and the largest yearly increase since 2008, when prices rose 4.9% year-over-year. While the CPI measures prices for a common “basket of goods,” not all prices rose equally; used car and truck prices rose 10% in the month of April alone, accounting for a third of the overall monthly increase. Additionally, food prices rose 2.4% and energy prices rose 25.1% over the last 12 months. Part of the April 2021 yearly increase came from unusually low inflation in early 2020, which saw the largest monthly decrease since 2008. Federal Reserve officials said as recently as Tuesday that they expected prices to rise temporarily and then slow down once supply chains recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. 
TITLE=> Trump Sues Facebook, Twitter and Google. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump filed a class action lawsuit on Wednesday against Facebook, Twitter, Google and their respective CEOs, alleging the tech companies “censored” the former president by banning him after the January 6 Capitol riot. Trump claimed that social media companies’ use of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act meant they had “ceased to be private” and had become “the de-facto censorship arm of the U.S. government.” “We're demanding an end to the shadow-banning, a stop to the silencing and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing and canceling that you know so well,” the former president said. The lawsuit is supported by the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump nonprofit led by former Trump officials.

Moderate Democrats including Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Az.) oppose the $3.5T pricetag, and Republicans are also mostly unified in opposition to it. And if a federal funding bill is not passed by midnight on Thursday, the federal government will partially shutdown. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday that the government will run out of resources to fund operations by mid-October if the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended; Republicans have voted against efforts to raise the debt ceiling, saying they won't enable Democrats' purportedly reckless spending plans.

According to the New York Times (Lean Left bias), Florida is averaging over 17,000 new COVID-19 cases per day, the highest infection rate the state has experienced during the pandemic. The average number of daily COVID-19 related deaths in Florida is currently increasing, but remains well below its pandemic peak.

TITLE=> Dems Accept GOP's Short-term Debt Limit Extension Offer. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) accepted an offer Thursday from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to raise the debt limit into December.  	McConnell said his offer gives Democrats time to increase the debt limit through budget reconciliation, which would allow it to pass without any GOP votes. Multiple Democrats reportedly indicated support for the deal Wednesday, though they oppose using reconciliation to raise the debt limit. Some Democrats see McConnell's offer as giving them more time to work out the spending package, which is currently held up by centrist Democrats who oppose the $3.5 trillion price tag. Other Democrats have accused McConnell and Republicans of politicizing the debt ceiling situation instead of acting quickly to avoid a potential economic recession. McConnell has repeatedly told Democrats to raise the debt limit with reconciliation since they already plan to use it to pass the Biden administration's multi-trillion dollar spending package.
TITLE=> House Passes $3.5T Budget Blueprint. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday night, the House of Representatives passed the blueprint for a $3.5 trillion budget plan.

ARTICLE=> Secretary of State Antony Blinken faced a second day of tough congressional questioning from lawmakers Tuesday about the Biden administration’s divisive withdrawal from Afghanistan. Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, New Jersey Democrat and committee chair Bob Menendez called the administration's withdrawal strategy "clearly and fatally flawed." He warned that he will "use of committee subpoena power to compel" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other Biden officials who dismiss the opportunity to appear before the committee. Menendez also told Blinken that the multiple administrations who "lied" about the stability of the Afghan government must face "accountability," requesting a full explanation that outlines their decision-making process. Idaho Republican Senator James Risch blamed the Biden administration of “ineptitude” that has tainted the country's international credibility, while Sen. Rand Paul called leaving the Bagram Airfield without notifying the base’s new Afghan commander "one of the worst military decisions in our history." Blinken has continually defended the Biden administration's withdrawal strategy, shifting the blame onto the Trump administration.

According to the study, which was funded by Pfizer, the vaccine's effectiveness against infection falls from 88% in the first month after inoculation to 47% after five months. However, the study says Pfizer's vaccine remains 90% effective after six months in preventing hospitalization against all COVID-19 variants, including Delta. Researchers analyzed health records of more than 3.4 million people for the study. Last month, the CDC recommended Pfizer's COVID-19 booster shot for people ages 65 and older, and for adults at high risk of severe COVID-19.
TITLE=> Congressman Sets April 23 Deadline for IRS To Turn Over Trump's Tax Returns. ARTICLE=> House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep.

If April 23 passes without the tax returns being provided or a resolution being met, House Democrats and the Trump administration may end up in federal court.  The administration missed an April 10 deadline as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin consulted with the Justice Department about the law to determine whether Neal had a legitimate legislative purpose to make the request. Under the law, Neal can request any taxpayer’s returns and the Treasury Department “shall furnish” them.

TITLE=> Texas, Missouri Sue Biden, Attempt to Reinstate 'Remain In Mexico' Policy. ARTICLE=> The state of Texas sued the Biden administration Tuesday in an attempt to reinstate a Trump-era policy that required migrants arriving at the southern border to wait in Mexico while applying for asylum, also known as the "Remain In Mexico" policy. The Trump administration implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program in January 2019; before that, migrants could wait inside the U.S. for a court decision, which often took months or years. President Biden ordered the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to suspend the policy soon after he took office in January.

Mueller III will testify before two House committees next month in a public session about his investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.

Democrats consider Mueller's public testimony to be crucial to their goal of building public support for impeachment. By the time Mueller testifies, the Justice Department inspector general may have released his report on the FBI’s use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) system in the early stages of the Russia probe, potentially bolstering Republican claims that FBI abuses occurred as part of that process.

TITLE=> Officer Indicted for 'Wanton Endangerment' In Breonna Taylor Case. ARTICLE=> Two police officers involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor will not face charges, while one officer was charged with three counts of "wanton endangerment," a Louisville grand jury found Wednesday. Taylor was killed March 13 after police entered her home with a "no-knock" warrant searching for illegal drugs. Two recently conducted independent investigations concluded that officers made their presence known before entering. A former detective who was fired in June was charged with wanton endangerment of Taylor's neighbors. The two other officers were not charged because they were reportedly justified under Kentucky law in returning fire after Taylor’s boyfriend shot an officer.  The announcement comes after a "state of emergency" was declared for Louisville police in anticipation of the case results. People gathered in downtown Louisville  Wednesday to protest the case results. 
TITLE=> ACLU, Planned Parenthood Amongst Plaintiffs in Lawsuit Against Alabama's New Abortion Law.

The ACLU and Planned Parenthood sued the Attorney General of Alabama and a list of District Attorneys for the state, attempting to stall the most restrictive abortion law in the country from going into effect in November. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed lawsuits against other states and their abortion bans; recently, a federal judge accepted an injunction against the State of Kentucky, striking down an abortion law which banned second trimester abortions, just weeks ago. The speculated goal, of both the states and the plaintiffs, seems to be to set up a duel in the ideologically conservative Supreme Court, in an attempt to overturn parts of Roe v. Wade.

The New York Post (Lean Right bias) first reported the admission; DeRosa released a statement Friday saying Cuomo's administration was "comprehensive and transparent in our responses" to the Justice Department after it sent Democrat governors a letter inquiring about nursing home fatalities on Aug. 26.

ARTICLE=> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to grant emergency use authorization of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to children as young as 12 by next week, the New York Times first reported Monday. If the FDA approves the decision, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) advisory panel will likely meet the day after to make recommendations for the shots’ use in teens. In March, Pfizer submitted data from a trial of nearly 2,300 adolescents between 12 and 15 years old, half of whom received the same two-shot regimen that has proven effective in adults.

ARTICLE=> A panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that a federal law banning the sale of handguns to those under the age of 21 is unconstitutional. The three-judge panel voted 2-1 on the law. "We first find that 18-year-olds possess Second Amendment rights," Judge Julius Richardson wrote in the majority opinion, adding that Congress used misleading data in 1968 to pass the law. "Congress may not restrict the rights of an entire group of law-abiding adults because a minuscule portion of that group commits a disproportionate amount of gun violence." Judge James A. Wynn Jr., who dissented, said the ruling opposed efforts to control gun violence. The law does not prohibit the possession of handguns by people under 21; it only prevents licensed dealers from selling to those under 21. The 4th Circuit's ruling will only apply to the five states of the circuit, which are Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina.

TITLE=> Supreme Court Dismisses Obamacare Challenge, Leaves Law Intact. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court rejected the latest GOP attempt to challenge the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, ruling 7-2 that the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the law. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, arguing that the plaintiffs could not bring their case to federal court because they had not shown any harm "fairly traceable" to Obamacare’s individual mandate, which Republicans lowered to $0 in 2017. Obamacare was still expected to survive beyond the question of standing, thanks to the opinions of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh that the individual mandate could be "severed" from the rest of the law. The court’s ruling leaves the entire law intact, including the individual mandate.

Diaz, told the Washington Post the autopsy found no evidence Sicknick suffered an allergic reaction to chemical irritants, and there was no evidence of internal or external injuries. Confusion and speculation spread after Sicknick's death when the New York Times reported that Sicknick had also been beaten with a fire extinguisher on Jan. 6; the Times' article has since been updated.

Milley also reportedly held a call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Jan. 8 in which he agreed with her evaluation that Trump was unstable. The book, titled “Peril,” is based on over 200 anonymous interviews and will be released next week.

The decision reversed a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that said Arizona's laws violate the VRA by resulting in racial discrimination.

McConnell called it "an easy decision," and Biden joked that " it doesn't look like it, but I am over 65...And that's why I'm getting my booster shot today."

TITLE=> U.S. Starts Formal Withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump sent a letter to the United Nations indicating his administration's intention to formally pull out of the Paris climate accord, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter Monday. The process is set to take exactly a year, and end a day after the 2020 presidential election. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. entered the deal in 2015 by committing to a 26-28 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, retroactive to 2005. Trump has promised to leave the accord since his 2016 presidential campaign, calling the deal unfair for the U.S. economy; the U.S. government is the only government in the world that publicly denounces the agreement.

ARTICLE=> On Wednesday night, President Joe Biden plans to unveil a $1.8 trillion "American Families Plan" aimed at buoying families during his address to a joint session of Congress.  The package proposes social welfare investments over a decade, in addition to $800 billion in tax benefits, which Biden will say can be paid for over 15 years. While Democrats may be pleased with much of the plan's contents, its price tag may raise some concern.  Republicans are already opposed to the cost of Biden's $2.25 trillion infrastructure package. Biden will make his case before a pared-down gathering of mask-wearing legislators due to coronavirus restrictions.
TITLE=> Biden Appoints All-Women White House Press Team. ARTICLE=> Projected 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden named his White House senior communications staff on Sunday, selecting a team of all women.

TITLE=> Alabama Senate Passes Bill Banning Nearly All Abortions. ARTICLE=> The Alabama Senate has passed a bill that would outlaw most abortions, allowing exceptions only to protect the mother's health.
TITLE=> Biden Supports Changes to Filibuster. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden is calling for changes to the filibuster to require lawmakers to speak on the floor of the Senate to hold up a bill, also known as the talking filibuster. Reform advocates say the legislative filibuster (which describes any attempt to block or delay Senate action on a bill through debating it at length, offering procedural motions, or otherwise delaying or obstructing it) causes issues for Biden's agenda in the 50-50 Senate.  The chamber’s Republican leader warns of “scorched-earth” tactics if Democrats use their new majority to bring an end to the legislative roadblock entirely.
TITLE=> Joe Biden Reverses Stance on Abortion Funding. ARTICLE=> Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden says he no longer supports the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal health care money to pay for abortions.
TITLE=> Gorsuch Breaks From Conservatives, Joins Liberals in Majority Opinion. ARTICLE=> On Monday morning, Neil Gorsuch, the first Trump appointee to the Supreme Court, broke with his fellow conservative justices to join an opinion. Herrera v. Wyoming was decided today in favor of the petitioner, who argued that a century-and-a-half old contract between the United States government and the Crow Tribe, of which he was a member, allowed him to hunt outside of any time restraints set by the State of Wyoming. The State of Wyoming argued that any contract between the United States government and the Crow Tribe became null and void when Wyoming attained statehood. The Supreme Court overturned the rulings of the lower courts, which ruled in favor of the State of Wyoming, and lead to Herrera's conviction for off-season hunting.
TITLE=> CFO of Trump Organization Surrenders Ahead of Facing Charges. ARTICLE=> Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, surrendered to federal prosecutors on Thursday ahead of expected criminal tax charges.  The exact charges were not immediately known, but they may focus on whether Trump Organization officials received benefits and perks, such as leased cars and rent-free apartments, without reporting them correctly on their tax returns. The Trump Organization says that Weisselberg is being used as a pawn to harm former President Donald Trump, though Trump himself is not expected to face any charges. An indictment of Weisselberg could undermine the Trump Organization's relationship with business partners and banks, and lead to fines and other penalties.
TITLE=> Rose McGowan Likens Democrats, GOP To a 'Cult' in Fox News Interview. ARTICLE=> Actress Rose McGowan said the Democratic Party is a "cult" on a Fox News appearance Monday. McGowan, best known for her acting career and for being a pioneering advocate for the #MeToo movement, said being raised in a cult gave her "the ability to see the control and the propaganda machine" in the U.S. "I do believe Democrats, most especially, are in a deep cult that they really don't know about and aren't really aware of," McGowan said, adding that Democrats are for "a system that is for so few people and benefits so few, but they masquerade as the helpers—we would do this, the world would be perfect if only those Republicans would get out of the way." After receiving criticism from the left for her interview, McGowan responded on Twitter, saying the interview caused a "cognitive dissonance" from someone who previously considered herself a Democrat, and that, "The fact that Fox News let someone like me on...is pretty f---ing extraordinary." McGowan also said that while she received backlash for calling Democrats a cult, she also said the same about the Republican Party during her interview.
TITLE=> Senate Overrides Trump's Defense Bill Veto. ARTICLE=> The Senate voted 81-13 to override President Donald Trump’s veto of the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act on Friday. This comes after the House voted 322-87 Monday to override Trump's veto. The bill includes funding for military programs, construction projects, a 3% pay raise for military, and renaming of military bases named for Confederate generals. Trump vetoed the defense bill last week for its potential to restrict the president's ability to withdraw troops, and because it excludes a repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This marks Congress' first veto override of Trump's administration; the president has vetoed nine bills during his presidency.

TITLE=> AG Barr Says His Job Made 'Impossible' by President Trump's Tweets. ARTICLE=> Attorney General William Barr's criticisms of the president's social media use have been covered similarly on all sides of the media spectrum. Barr said in an interview with ABC News Thursday that Trump's tweets make it "impossible" for him to effectively fill his role at the Department of Justice. The department announced earlier this week it would reduce its originally recommended prison sentence for former Trump adviser Roger Stone, a move that drew praise from the president on Twitter while prompting criticism and accusations of political interference between the White House and the DOJ from others.
TITLE=> U.S Senate to Vote on Slimmed Down COVID-19 Relief Bill.

TITLE=> Trump Social Media Accounts Banned 'Indefinitely'. ARTICLE=> Facebook said Thursday that President Donald Trump's accounts will be banned from the platform and from Instagram "indefinitely," or at least until the end of his term. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement, "we believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great." This comes after Twitter, Facebook and Youtube enacted a 24-hour ban on the president's accounts after concerns his posts were spreading false election fraud claims and inciting violence. Twitch and Snapchat have also joined the social media platforms who have banned Trump's accounts 'indefinitely.'  Some voices from the left, including former First Lady Michelle Obama and Sen. Mark R. Warner, D-Va., criticized Facebook and other Big Tech companies for not banning Trump sooner. Some voices from the right, including Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, tended to frame Facebook's ban as "censorship" of Trump, also painting the restrictions as a show of tech companies' power and sovereignty over the sharing of ideas and information.
TITLE=> Emails Show Trump Pressed DOJ to Back Election Fraud Claims. ARTICLE=> The Trump White House urged Department of Justice officials to challenge the 2020 election results based on unproven claims of fraud, according to emails released Tuesday by the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In one case, former President Donald Trump’s assistant emailed fraud claims to then-Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen less than an hour before Trump tweeted that Rosen would replace then-Attorney General William Barr, who had publicly stated that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud. In another case, then-acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue wrote “Pure insanity” in response to a fraud theory sent by Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows.

TITLE=> White House Legal Team Decries Alleged Election Fraud, Projects Trump as Winner. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell led a press conference Thursday, claiming to have proof of a mass conspiracy to elect Joe Biden and manipulate the 2020 presidential election results against Trump.

Charles Schwab, Citigroup, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Microsoft have halted all political contributions to both Republicans and Democrats. American Express, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Commerce Bank, Dow Chemical, Morgan Stanley and Marriott International each stopped their contributions specifically to members of Congress who they say “impeded the peaceful transfer of power” by opposing the certification of President-elect Joe Biden. 
TITLE=> Justice Department Releases Carter Page FISA Documents. ARTICLE=> The Department of Justice on Saturday released a previously top-secret, heavily redacted set of documents related to the wiretapping of Carter Page in 2016. Page was a Trump campaign adviser at that time, and his surveillance has since become a controversial topic, with both the Democratic and Republican Intelligence Committee memos being released earlier this year. President Trump has reacted on Twitter, saying the documents "confirm with little doubt that the Department of 'Justice' and FBI misled the courts."
TITLE=> Fauci and Rand Paul Clash Over Pandemic Origins, US Funding for Wuhan Lab. ARTICLE=> Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci clashed during a Senate health committee hearing Tuesday over the COVID-19 pandemic's origins. Paul accused Fauci of funding controversial "gain-of-function" research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in Wuhan, China; the research allegedly focused on mutating animal viruses to infect humans. Fauci denied Paul's allegations, calling them "entirely and completely incorrect." Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) previously funded WIV research into bat-borne diseases and how they could affect humans. Questions remain about the ultimate origin of the virus, and whether it moved from animals to humans or leaked from a laboratory. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called the lab leak theory "the least likely hypothesis," while also saying it "requires further investigation." Former CDC chief Robert Redfield is among the lab leak theory's prominent supporters.
TITLE=> Trump Says US Will Remain 'Steadfast Partner' of Saudi Arabia, No New Punishment for Journalist Jamal Khashoggi's Murder. ARTICLE=> President Trump announced that the US will remain a "steadfast partner" of Saudi Arabia, signaling there will be no new punishment for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder.

Others have said that his approach is strategic and will preserve US-Saudi relations and counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East.
TITLE=> White House Suspends Billions in Obamacare Insurer Payments.

TITLE=> Biden Admin to Send 1M Vaccine Doses to Retail Pharmacies Next Week. ARTICLE=> The federal government will begin shipping COVID-19 vaccines directly to retail pharmacies across the country next week. The initial rollout will send 1 million doses to 6,500 pharmacies, which will typically be located away from current vaccination sites and geared toward "socially vulnerable" populations; the plan is to eventually send more than 11 million doses to 40,000 pharmacies. The news comes as the number of Americans who've received at least one shot of a coronavirus vaccine has passed the total number of Americans who've tested positive for the virus at any point. Pfizer reportedly plans to distribute 200 million more vaccine doses by May; however, concerns are surfacing about how current vaccines will work against new and emerging coronavirus strains.
TITLE=> Antiviral Drug Remdesivir Approved as COVID-19 Treatment by FDA. ARTICLE=> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences, as a treatment for COVID-19 Thursday. The drug, sold under the name Veklury, will be used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Previously authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID-19, it has become the first FDA-approved treatment for the virus. Typically administered in five doses through an IV, remdesivir has shown to shorten recovery time by working to stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, a World Health Organization (WHO) study has found that four drugs, including remdesivir, have no effect in curing the virus. President Donald Trump was administered remdesivir along with several other drugs during his bout with the virus earlier this month. 
TITLE=> NRA Files for Bankruptcy, Plans to Move from New York to Texas. ARTICLE=> The National Rifle Association (NRA) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week.

TITLE=> YouTube Removes Project Veritas Video on Google Bias. ARTICLE=> YouTube, which is owned by Google, removed a video created by nonprofit Project Veritas, a site that aims to expose corruption, about Google and its alleged bias. The video showed undercover footage of Google's Head of Responsible Innovation Jen Gennai discussing the tech giant’s search algorithm. Those on the right say Gennai’s comments mean Google is biased and the search giant is taking a role in influencing what information is available to shape elections. Gennai says the video was selectively edited to appear ominous. As of Tuesday evening, the story is largely being ignored by media outlets on the left.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Lifts Ban on California In-Person Worship Services, Leaves Some Restrictions. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court issued emergency relief Friday to remove California’s ban on indoor church services placed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The high court's ruling comes after the South Bay United Pentecostal Church in Chula Vista and the Harvest Rock Church in Pasadena argued that the state violated religious liberty when it placed restrictions on in-person worship attendance based on COVID-19 cases in California. The order limits indoor capacity to 25% and still places a prohibition on singing and chanting during indoor services. The Court voted 6-3 in favor of lifting the ban, while leaving some restrictions in place. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas said they would have removed restrictions completely, while the three liberal justices dissented. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh said it wasn’t clear at this point whether the singing ban was being applied “across the board."

The person shot was a 44 year-old black grandmother, Pamela Turner, who was well known to the community as being schizophrenic. She was being arrested for having outstanding warrants; a struggle started after Turner allegedly used the officer's taser against him, according to Baytown Police Lt. Steve Dorris.

TITLE=> New Findings Suggest Epstein's Death Was Homicide. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner hired by Jeffrey Epstein's brother, said evidence suggests that Epstein died by strangulation. Baden says several of Epstein's injuries, including the breaking of the hyoid bone in the neck, "are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings." NYC chief medical examiner Barbara Sampson, who ruled Epstein's death a suicide after he was found hanging in his Manhattan jail cell August 10 while awaiting trial, disputed Baden's findings and stood by the initial autopsy.  Some conspiracy theorists have suggested Epstein was murdered, even going as far as suggesting the Clintons, Prince Andrew, and President Donald Trump were somehow involved.
TITLE=> Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. 50 Years Later. ARTICLE=> On the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, his legacy was both revered and debated.

ARTICLE=> U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan hosted China's top diplomat and foreign minister for discussions in Anchorage, Alaska on Thursday. The talks reportedly went over the planned two hours.

TITLE=> FDA Gives Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Full Approval. ARTICLE=> The Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Monday for people 16 and older. It's the first COVID-19 vaccine to be upgraded from emergency use authorization to full approval; it was first approved for emergency use eight months ago. “While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock as part of Monday's announcement.
TITLE=> Biden Asks Supreme Court to Cancel Border Wall, Asylum Arguments. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to postpone upcoming oral arguments and delay further action in two appeals regarding the Mexico-United States border wall funding and the "remain in Mexico" asylum policy, both filed by former President Donald Trump.

The court was set to hear arguments in the two cases on Feb. 22 and March 1. The Justice Department also asked the Supreme Court to suspend oral arguments in a separate case in March on the Trump policy requiring non-Mexican migrants to remain in Mexico until their next court dates in the U.S. The DOJ is expected to begin more filings as the new administration makes changes on immigration, LGBTQ+ protections, voting rights, healthcare and more.

TITLE=> Intelligence Community Divided and Uncertain on COVID-19 Origins in New Report. ARTICLE=> US intelligence agencies reached varied and relatively uncertain conclusions on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an unclassified two-page report released Friday. Four unnamed intelligence agencies and the National Intelligence Council assessed with low confidence that the virus most likely originated naturally, one agency assessed with moderate confidence that the virus most likely came from a “laboratory-associated incident,” and three agencies said they were unable to come to a conclusion without additional information. All agencies agreed that both origin theories were “plausible,” that the virus was not a biological weapon, and that Chinese officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the first outbreak. Both the report and a statement from President Joe Biden criticized China for withholding information and called on China to cooperate with investigators. Biden had requested the intelligence community’s investigation in May. 
TITLE=> Prince Philip, Husband of Queen Elizabeth, Dies at 99. ARTICLE=> Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh,, has died at the age of 99.  His life spanned nearly a century of European history, starting with his birth as a member of the Greek royal family and ending as Britain’s longest serving consort. A former naval officer and keen polo player, Philip enjoyed robust health well into old age but had several health issues in recent years, undergoing heart surgery earlier this year. An official notice of his death was posted on the railings of Buckingham Palace, as is traditional, but was being removed shortly afterwards to avoid crowds gathering. With Covid-19 restrictions still in place, the public elements of the final farewell will not be able to take place in their original form.
TITLE=> White House Rules Out Involvement In 'Vaccine Passports'. ARTICLE=> White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday the Biden administration will not be supporting a "vaccine passport" system that requires Americans to carry a credential. "There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential," Psaki said. She added that that the decision to employ vaccination credentials would be left to nongovernmental entities in private and nonprofit sectors. Some states such as New York, however, are establishing a digital app people can use to offer proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or recent negative test. Florida and Texas governors recently issued executive orders prohibiting state and local governments from issuing vaccination credentials; the orders also prohibit businesses that receive state funding from requiring proof of vaccination. 
TITLE=> Navy, President Trump At Odds Over Eddie Gallagher's SEAL Designation. ARTICLE=> The United States Navy announced Thursday that it's moving forward with a review and possible removal of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher from the Navy SEALs, despite opposition from President Donald Trump.

The Navy is deciding whether or not to remove Gallagher's Trident Pin, the official membership pin of the SEALs; President Trump told the Navy to cancel its planned demotion of Gallagher from chief petty officer to petty officer first class last Friday.

TITLE=> Office of Special Counsel: Conway Violated the Hatch Act. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, the Office for the Special Counsel released a report stating that Kellyanne Conway, adviser to the President, violated the Hatch Act a number of times. The Hatch Act prevents some employees of the executive branch from making politically-motivated statements, with exceptions for the President, Vice President, and  other specific positions- none of which Conway held. According to the report, Conway violated the Hatch Act by repeatedly disparaging Democratic candidates during interviews, social media posts, and press releases. The Hatch Act was implemented in 1939 and designed to keep non-political appointments away from partisan divide. The White House has rejected the report, and insists that the Department of Justice withdraw it.
TITLE=> Migrants Arriving at Southern Border Rose Significantly in February. ARTICLE=> U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said Wednesday that border agents encountered 100,441 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in February. CBP commissioner Troy Miller said more than 19,000 of those encounters were families, approximately 9,500 were unaccompanied minors and the rest were adults. This marks an increase of over 100% in children and families at the border between January and February, and a 60% increase in unaccompanied minors. Roberta Jacobson, Biden's National Security Council coordinator for the southern border, said Wednesday that the prospect of "a more humane policy" under Biden "may have" contributed to an uptick in the number of migrants at the border since the new administration took office. Biden's immigration policies currently faces broad Republican criticism; the February number marks the highest monthly total since a major border surge in mid-2019.

Shortly after, Biden confirmed in an interview with MSNBC that he would debate Trump, saying he would use the debates as an opportunity to be a “fact checker on the floor." Pelosi later told MSNBC later Thursday that her comments have nothing to do with Biden, and that Biden is "a great debater."

The release also said prosecutors would release additional information "as to not disrupt any investigation that may be taking place in Wisconsin."

TITLE=> Dems Push Forward on $1.9T Pandemic Aid; GOP Concerned with Cost. ARTICLE=> Congressional Democrats plan to move ahead on President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package next week, as Republican lawmakers criticize the cost and Democrats' purported inflexibility on the details. Instead of getting the 60 Senate votes usually needed to pass legislation, Democrats could use something called budget reconciliation to advance the proposal with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris. Budget reconciliation can be used once per fiscal year in the Senate to resolve budget-related issues; Republicans tried to use it twice during Trump's administration. Stimulus checks details remain a particular point of division. Some progressive Democrats have asked Biden to consider recurring stimulus payments; others are asking Biden to cut off payments for families earning over $75,000.
TITLE=> Jobless Claims Drop to Pandemic-Era Low of 498,000. ARTICLE=> New weekly jobless claims, released by the Department of Labor, fell to a pandemic-era low last week of 498,000. It was the first month since March 2020 with claims below 500,000, with initial filings trending lower in recent weeks amid the pick-up in economic activity.

TITLE=> S. Africa COVID-19 Variant Detected In US; Vaccine Manufacturers Test Effectiveness Against It. ARTICLE=> The COVID-19 variant B.1351, first identified in South Africa, has been confirmed for the first time in the United States as vaccine developers test their drug's effectiveness against the new variant. The Svariant has raised concerns over being more contagious than other strains of the virus, and for potentially evading the immunity provided by antibodies. According to a release from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control on Thursday, two cases have been reported in the state, though there is no known travel history or connection between the cases. The World Health Organization reports that the variant has been reported in 31 countries. Vaccine manufacturers  Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech said their vaccine would still prevent the new strain, though its effects were weaker against it. Moderna is currently working on a "booster" against the new virus. On Thursday, Novavax Inc. said its U.K. trial is 89.3% effective in preventing COVID-19, but was just less than 50% effective in preventing the South Africa variant. 
TITLE=> Arizona and Wisconsin Certify Biden Victories, Trump Campaign Files Lawsuit. ARTICLE=> Arizona and Wisconsin certified Joe Biden’s presidential election victories on Monday. Officials from both parties in each state said their elections were "conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness."

On Tuesday, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin’s results, alleging that roughly 220,000 ballots from mostly Democratic counties violated state law.
TITLE=> Series of Opinions on Biden vs. Harris Debate. ARTICLE=> Since the democratic debate on June 27th, Kamala Harris (D–California) has gained significant popularity in the polls.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said on Wednesday that he could not “vote to certify the Electoral College results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws.” Hawley is the first Republican senator to raise such an objection, joining a group of objecting House Republicans and defying Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s opposition to further challenges. Hawley’s backing will guarantee a debate over the objections in both houses of Congress. Hawley’s statement also cited similar objections made by Democrats after the 2004 and 2016 elections. In 2004, a California senator and an Ohio representative made a protest objection that they said was not intended to challenge the election result. In 2016, some Democratic representatives made objections, but their motion failed quickly without backing from the Senate.
TITLE=> Senate Republicans Make New Infrastructure Offer. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, Senate Republicans unveiled their infrastructure counteroffer to President Joe Biden, aiming to spend more than $920 billion on fixing the nation’s roads and bridges. The Republican senators said their offer delivers on “core infrastructure investments” that Biden has focused on as areas of potential bipartisan agreement. The White House and Democrats are likely to find the counteroffer as not being ambitious enough. The Republican plan would increase spending by $91 billion on roads and bridges, $48 billion on water resources and $25 billion on airports. It would also include a one-time $65 billion increase in broadband investments.

The New York Times reported on Friday that Trump had been briefed on the matter and that the National Security Council had held a meeting about it in late March.
TITLE=> Nancy Pelosi Elected Speaker of the House. ARTICLE=> As Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday, Nancy Pelosi won the speakership, vowing to focus on climate change, health care, and LGBTQ equality. Some criticized Pelosi and the Democrats for their agenda, characterizing it as fiscally irresponsible, weak on border security, and obstructionist in their plans to investigate President Trump.

TITLE=> House Votes to Impeach Trump. ARTICLE=> The U.S. House of Representatives voted 232-197 Wednesday to impeach President Donald Trump for “inciting violence against the government of the United States” following the breach of the U.S. Capitol building last week.

The Senate will vote next, but not until after President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration Jan. 20, according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

TITLE=> U.S. House Committee Advances D.C. Statehood Bill. ARTICLE=> The House Oversight Committee voted Wednesday to advance the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which would make Washington, D.C. the first state, to the full chamber. The committee voted 25 to 19 along party lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans against the act. It now moves onto the full chamber, where its odds of passage by the Democratic-controlled House are favorable. However, the act still faces Republican opposition in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. The bill passed the House last Congress, but never made it to a vote before the Republican-controlled Senate. Those who support the bill say that the issue is a voting rights issue, and that D.C. residents are entitled to federal representation and local self-governance. Those who oppose the bill say it is a Democratic plan to gain two new seats in the Senate, given the district’s liberal electorate, and that it would lead to the district's outsized electoral influence due to the 23rd Amendment.

Voices have focused especially on how it may impact President Donald Trump's reelection chances, and have also looked at how Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Vice President Joe Biden will supposedly mold campaign strategy around virus policies and responses. Others focused on logistical impacts of the virus on campaign and election events; after Sanders and Biden each canceled campaign events earlier this week, the Democratic National Committee announced that the Biden-Sanders debate scheduled for March 15 will have no live audience and will be held at CNN's Washington D.C. studios instead of in Arizona.

TITLE=> SCOTUS Punts Decision on Oregon Wedding Cake Case. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court of the United States sent a familiar case back to the lower courts on Monday. The new case involved a Christian baker from Oregon who refused to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple. The case was sent back to the lower courts for reconsideration based on the precedent set by Masterpiece Bakery v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The Colorado case was decided last summer, 7-2, with Ginsberg and Sotomayor dissenting. The bakers in both Colorado and Oregon argued that their cakes are part of their artistic expression and are thus protected by the First Amendment. They further argued that their freedom of religion protects their right to run their private business the way they wish to. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the broader intersection of religious freedom and same-sex discrimination.
TITLE=> Pelosi to Announce If She Will Create Committee to Probe Jan. 6 Capitol Breach. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce this week whether she will create a committee to investigate the deadily violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Some news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, reported that Pelosi said she will create the probe committee, which would not require support from the GOP; Pelosi's deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill clarified in a tweet Tuesday, saying "Speaker Pelosi told Members she plans to announce WHETHER she will create a select committee THIS WEEK," and that her preference is still a "bipartisan commission which Senate Republicans are blocking." This comes after Republicans blocked the creation of a bipartisan committee last month. Two Senate committees released bipartisan reports examining Capitol security and the law enforcement response to the violence, but Democrats say broader investigations are still needed. 
TITLE=> Viral Edited Video of Trump Flagged as Misinformation on Twitter. ARTICLE=> On Sunday evening, an edited clip  of President Donald Trump went viral on social media. The 12-second clip, edited out of a 2019 C-SPAN interview with Trump, showed the president walking to a helicopter before stopping to point to a puddle on the ground outside of the White House. Some Twitter users tweeted the video along with comments that Trump looked "confused" and "disoriented." "Trump was simply walking back to wait for FLOTUS here," ABC reporter Will Steakin pointed out in a tweet. "This false tweet has over 23K retweets and the deceptively edited video has over 2 million views." On Monday, Twitter added a "manipulated media" tag to the video, and it was apparently taken down shortly after.

Shanahan and his ex-wife have both accused each other of assault, with her being arrested at one point. Apparently, those charges were dropped and led to the divorce. President Trump tweeted this morning that Shanahan had decided not to continue with his nomination process in order to spend more time with his family.

The strike drew comment from President Trump, who urged both sides to make a deal. President Trump first tweeted about the negotiations in March, encouraging both sides to get the contract done early to avoid strikes.
TITLE=> Senate Approves $1.9 Trillion Stimulus Bill. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Senate passed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package early Saturday morning, after a 27-hour marathon overnight session. Senators voted 50-49, with every Republican voting against the bill, and with one Republican absent. The package kept $1,400 in direct payments for Americans under a certain income threshold and $350 billion to help state and local governments reopen, but scaled back unemployment benefits to $300 a week until early September, and cut a federal $15 minimum wage proposal amid pressure from moderate Democrats. On Saturday morning, President Joe Biden told reporters the package was "one more giant step forward" on delivering on his promise for more pandemic relief. Republican lawmakers heavily criticized the bill; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said "the Senate has never spent $2 trillion in a more haphazard way or through a less rigorous process." The legislation will be sent to the House for approval before it reaches Biden's desk.⁣⁣The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Left-rated outlets tended to provide analysis of various items on the bill.

Va.) published an op-ed Sunday in the Charleston Gazette-Mail explaining why he won't vote for the For the People Act, a Democratic-backed bill aimed at revamping voting access in U.S. elections. Manchin criticized the bill as partisan and said it "will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy." After passing the House along party lines, Senate Republicans blocked the bill's passage with a filibuster last month. Manchin's opposition to the bill likely means it will fail to pass in Congress.

TITLE=> Manchin Doubles Down on $1.5 Trillion Limit for Democrats' Budget Reconciliation Bill. ARTICLE=> West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin doubled down Thursday on a $1.5 trillion maximum for Democrats’ budget reconciliation bill, which was previously expected to spend $3.5 trillion over the next ten years. Manchin called the $3.5 trillion figure “fiscal insanity” in a Wednesday statement, arguing that “we can’t even pay for the essential social programs, like Social Security and Medicare.” On Thursday, a leaked memo revealed that Manchin had proposed a deal to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in July to limit the bill to $1.5 trillion. Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema also reiterated her opposition to a $3.5 trillion figure on Thursday. Manchin and Sinema’s statements sparked renewed criticism from other Democrats, some of whom reiterated threats to block the bipartisan infrastructure bill unless progress was made on the budget reconciliation bill. In the face of unanimous Republican opposition, Democrats need Manchin and Sinema’s votes to pass any version of their budget bill.

Though President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation years prior in 1862, June 19, 1865 marks the anniversary of when the final enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. The recognition of Juneteenth as a national holiday comes amid a larger national movement examining race and racism in American history. The bill was sponsored by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 60 senators; Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) reportedly asked senators to unanimously pass the bill, and no senator objected. The bill received wide praise from lawmakers across the political aisle, including the bill's lead GOP sponsor Sen. John Cornyn (R.-Tx.) and Schumer. This comes after Sen. Ron Johnson (R.-Wis.) clarified that he did not intend to block the bill, though he criticized the “cost and lack of the debate,” and said he thought it was "kind of odd" that "apparently the only way to do that is to give 2 million federal workers a paid day off, cost American taxpayers $600 million.” The bill will now move onto the Democratic-led U.S. House.

Researchers estimate the U.K. strain has spread to at least 33 states in the U.S., according to the CDC data, and makes up 2% of all U.S. COVID-19 cases, which may mean up to 1,000 people are contracting the strain every day.

The heat may also be contributing to a 21,000-acre wildfire in Montana. This comes on the back of a historic drought, which some have called “biblical” and “potentially the worst drought in 1,200 years.” The heat wave has also affected areas in Mexico and Canada, and the Middle East is experiencing its own heat wave on the other side of the planet. Meteorologists have tied the heat to climate change as well as a “heat dome” where high pressure traps in hot air.

TITLE=> Gallagher Found Not Guilty on All Counts Except One.

Gallagher was found guilty of taking unofficial pictures with the corpse of the dead ISIS soldier. Gallagher's attorneys suggest that his arraignment and legal process has been part of a larger scheme by his subordinates to mutiny. Military juries, unlike civilian juries, need only a two-thirds majority to reach any decision; meaning that only five out of the seven jurors needed to concur to make a decision. Voices on both the left and right sides of the media referenced the fact that key prosecution witness Corey Scott — a Navy SEAL medic — changed his story during the course of the trial. The maximum penalty for one offense of posing for unofficial pictures with a dead body is four months imprisonment. During the trial, it was revealed that members of Gallagher's unit regularly and deliberately posed for pictures with dead bodies for trophy. It is unknown as to what the repercussion of the verdict will be on military policy.

However, Torres noted in a filing that a pardon implies guilt, writing "If there be no guilt, there is no ground for forgiveness...it is an appeal to executive clemency. It is asked as a matter of favor to the guilty. It is granted not of right but of grace. A party is acquitted on the ground of innocence; he is pardoned through favor."

ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, the Trump administration issued a ban on all cotton and tomato imports from western China’s Xinjiang region due to allegations that they are made with forced labor from detained Uighur Muslims, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Xinjiang accounts for nearly 20% of global cotton production; the U.S. imported $9 billion in cotton products and $10 million in tomatoes from China last year. “Imports made on the cheap by using forced labor hurt American businesses that respect human rights and also expose unsuspecting consumers to unethical purchases,” CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said in the statement.

Historian Carter G. Woodson established the precursor to Black History Month in 1926 by dedicating a week; in 1976, former President Gerald Ford expanded the week into Black History Month. Many have utilized Black History Month to call for racial justice and to continue to speak about the events black communities in the U.S. have faced in the past year, including deaths and job losses from COVID-19, police brutality and the killing of George Floyd, which prompted nationwide protests and the spread of the Black Lives Matter Movement.

TITLE=> Biden Defends Comments About Working With Segregationists. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden defended his comments on working with segregationists Wednesday night. The presidential candidate had received criticism for saying things were civil even when he had to work with segregationists during his time in Congress.

We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today you look at the other side and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don’t talk to each other anymore.” Many fellow Democratic presidential candidates criticized Biden, with Cory Booker (D-NJ) saying Biden should apologize for "using his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of how to make our country better." Biden refused, defending his record on civil rights and saying, "There's not a racist bone in my body."

The new proposal by Biden is significantly lower than his initial $2.3 trillion proposal; however, it is still higher than the Republican $928 billion counteroffer that would draw much of the money from unspent funds originally set aside for coronavirus relief legislation and $257 billion in new spending. Biden, however, is still reportedly still committed to funding the bill with a corporate tax hike, which the GOP has taken a firm stance against as it would undo the party's 2017 tax cuts. Biden is expected to meet again with Capito Friday.

TITLE=> Health Experts Speculate About Herd Immunity In The U.S.. ARTICLE=> Nearly one year into widespread COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, vaccine rollouts and a decline in new cases have health experts speculating about when the country will reach herd immunity. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, surgeon and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine professor Marty Makary said he believes herd immunity to the virus would be when 60% to 80% have been infected or vaccinated, and that the U.S. could reach the number by April. According to Makary, about 8% of the population has been infected and 15% of the population vaccinated; additionally, he said, since many COVID-19 cases are not recorded because not everyone gets tested, he estimated the real number is possibly 55%, and that the 60% threshold could be reached by April. Others warn that herd immunity depends on several factors that vary by region, such as restrictions, vaccination rate and infection rate. In addition, some warn it is still unknown how long immunity from vaccines will last or how current vaccines will protect against new variants of the virus. On Sunday, former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CBS he thinks the U.S. may never reach full herd immunity against the virus, saying "Covid is going to continue to circulate at a low level."

In their investigation published Easter Sunday, the Times "found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden.” Originally, that sentence continued after "Mr. Biden" by saying: "...beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.” The Times later removed that section without an explanation in the story.  Executive editor Dean Baquet said in an interview published Monday that the change was made because "the [Biden] campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct, and that’s not what the sentence was intended to say."

TITLE=> Cuomo Defends Pandemic Response, Says Pausing Nursing Home Death Numbers Was a Mistake. ARTICLE=> New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Monday defended his administration’s COVID-19 response and acknowledged that the lack of transparency regarding COVID-19 related deaths in nursing homes in New York was a mistake. Cuomo said the state Health Department “paused” state lawmakers’ inquiry into nursing home death data to focus on addressing the general pandemic and the Justice Department's request for similar information in August; Cuomo also said that both chambers of state legislature were informed of the decision. This comes after Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa told state legislators the administration “froze” releasing information about nursing home deaths out of concern the DOJ would launch a federal investigation. New York Attorney General Letitia James also accused the Cuomo administration of severely undercounting those deaths connected to nursing homes. In late January, the state had reported 8,500 deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, leaving out those who died outside of the facilities, such as after being transferred to a hospital.

TITLE=> Manchin's Election Bill Compromise Praised by Abrams, Rejected by McConnell. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) released a list of proposed changes to Democrats' For the People Act intended as a bipartisan compromise. Manchin, who opposed the initial version of the bill, proposed an edited version that would ban gerrymandering, require a minimum of 15 consecutive days of early voting, enact a voter ID requirement with alternate ways of identification, and make Election Day a holiday. Voting rights activist Stacey Abrams praised Manchin's version during an appearance on CNN Thursday, saying, "the restrictions on the forms of ID should meet the needs of the people. And what he is proposing makes sense because...we should not narrow the playing field so much that we push voters out of participation simply because of restrictions that make no sense and do not increase security." However, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he opposed Manchin's version, saying it would turn the Federal Election Commission (FEC) "from a judge into a prosecutor" and would "remove redistricting from state legislatures and hand it over to computers." McConnell added that he hoped "all Republicans" would oppose the proposal. The Democrats' bill is set for a vote early next week, where it needs 60 votes to pass the 50-50 Senate.

In an interview with German news outlet Deutsche Welle released Wednesday, former President George W.

Sputnik V has yet to undergo “Phase 3” trials, a standard of vaccine development in which a vaccine is tested on thousands of people over several months.
TITLE=> Biden, Bush and Other Political Figures Point To Unity On 9/11 Anniversary. ARTICLE=> To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many political leaders highlighted the unity and resiliency that once helped Americans move forward. The White House shared a pre-recorded message from President Biden on Friday, calling unity "the central lesson" of the 9/11 attacks. "Unity doesn't mean we have to believe the same thing," Biden said. "But we must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other and in this nation." Biden then stood alongside former presidents Barrack Obama and Bill Clinton at the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum on Saturday. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President George W. Bush further emphasized the significance of unity at the memorial service for the victims and heroes of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, PA. Harris said "we were all reminded that unity is possible in America" in the days following the 9/11 attacks. While Bush said those days of unity "seem distant from our own," that time represented "the truest version of ourselves" and "what we can be again." Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump launched a partisan attack against Biden “and his inept administration" for surrendering “in defeat” by withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.

Fauci said that "If we keep lingering without getting those people vaccinated that should be vaccinated, this thing could linger on, leading to the development of another variant which could complicate things." Roughly 90 million eligible Americans have not received the COVID-19 vaccine. Fauci added: "“I respect people’s freedom, but when you’re talking about a public health crisis that we’ve been going through now for well over a year and a half, the time has come." Fauci also apologized for and corrected a prediction he made in an NPR interview Monday, in which he predicted better control of the pandemic "into the fall and the winter" rather than Spring 2022.

TITLE=> Hamas Rockets, Israeli Airstrikes Continue for Second Day. ARTICLE=> Hamas and Israel continued firing rockets and launching airstrikes on Tuesday, marking a second day of violence after two Israelis and 28 Palestinians, including 10 Palestinian children, were killed Monday. The violence comes after weeks of growing tensions between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police over Israel’s attempts to evict Palestinian families from East Jerusalem. Additionally, Israeli police blocked Palestinians from accessing certain parts of Jerusalem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and a Jewish supremacy group chanted “Death to Arabs” as it marched through the city. Clashes broke out on multiple nights at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site for Muslims, where an Israeli police raid left 305 Palestinians injured on Monday. Later that day, Palestinian militant group Hamas fired over 150 rockets from Gaza at Israel. Israel responded by launching at least 130 airstrikes in Gaza, which it said targeted Hamas operatives. Monday was also Jerusalem Day, when Israelis celebrate the 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem. 
TITLE=> Stage Set for Decisive Senate Races in Georgia. ARTICLE=> Georgia voters will cast their ballots in two special U.S. Senate elections on Jan. 5 that will decide which political party controls the 50-member Congressional body. Incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are facing challenges from Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff; none of the four candidates gained 50% of the vote in the initial election, so state law requires that a "runoff" election — essentially a rematch — be held. With all other Senate races effectively decided, Republicans currently hold 50 seats to Democrats' 48. Wins for Warnock and Ossoff would create a straight 50-50 tie in the Senate, which would make the vice president the tie-breaking vote.

The two are known for their $50 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which spends approximately $5 billion a year on education and disease eradication. "We continue to share a belief in that mission and will continue our work together at the foundation," the statement read, "but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives." A Gates spokesperson said that both will remain co-chairs and trustees, and that the foundation does not expect any changes to its work. Bill Gates is currently the world’s fourth-richest person, with a $130 billion net worth. While a divorce is typically a private matter, people across the nation reacted to the Gates' divorce in different ways. Some provided speculation and analysis regarding the future of the Gates' charitable foundation, given how a change in the charity could impact public life. Others created internet memes about the couples' divorce news, some playful and some harsh. Still others encouraged empathy for the Gates family as they navigate a difficult situation, and appreciation for their charity work that has impacted people around the globe.
TITLE=> Bipartisan Police Reform Negotiations Collapse. ARTICLE=> Lawmakers have failed to strike a bipartisan police reform deal after months of negotiations in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others. In a statement Wednesday, President Joe Biden said he still hopes to pass a "comprehensive and meaningful police reform bill" and chastised Republicans for purportedly rejecting "modest reforms, which even the previous president had supported." Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a lead negotiator, said his Democratic "negotiating partners walked away from the table." A key point of disagreement was on reforming qualified immunity, which protects individual police officers from civil liability for misconduct. Democrats and Republicans seemed aligned on other details, including banning chokeholds, boosting funds for mental health resources and cutting off the transfer of military equipment to police. The future of bipartisan police reform legislation is now unclear.

DeSantis' ruling comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that all K-12 students should wear masks when they return to school. While the Florida governor called the CDC's new guidelines "a huge mistake," he also noted that students whose parents want them to wear masks should be able to do so.

Funding will come from President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan.

This was the first time Republicans used the filibuster this legislative session, as support grows among Democrats for reforming or abolishing the practice. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine), Bill Cassidy (La.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) voted in favor. Eleven senators missed the vote, including Democrats Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Patty Murray (Wash.). House Democrats previously passed the bill in a 252-175 vote with the support of 35 Republicans.

TITLE=> Media, Fauci Acknowledge COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory After Dismissing It Initially. ARTICLE=> The theory that the COVID-19 outbreak may have begun with a laboratory leak in Wuhan, China is gaining more credence in the U.S. and internationally after it was dismissed by some early on in the pandemic. Major news sources including CNN (Left bias), the New York Times (Lean Left) and PolitiFact (Lean Left) are among the sources who initially described the hypothesis as a debunked conspiracy, but have recently deemed it at least somewhat plausible amid emerging circumstantial evidence and growing calls to investigate it further. Conversely, many right-rated media sources have reported on the theory since the pandemic’s outset. 
TITLE=> Space Force Commander Removed After Claiming US Military's Diversity Training is 'Marxist'. ARTICLE=> A Space Force commander was reportedly relieved from his post after he criticized the U.S. military on a conservative podcast. Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lohmeier appeared on The Steve Gruber Show to discuss his new book, which claims that Marxist beliefs are becoming more common in the armed forces. On the podcast, Lohmeier said he has witnessed “fundamentally incompatible and competing narratives of what America was, is and should be.”  Lohmeier also said that "the military's inclusion and equity industry and the trainings we're receiving in the military via that industry are rooted in critical race theory which is rooted in Marxism." A Defense Department official said in a statement to CNN that Lohmeier was relieved from his command “due to loss of trust and confidence in his ability to lead.” A Department of Defense directive states that active duty service members may not participate in partisan activities, such as speaking before a partisan gathering; Lieutenant General Stephen Whiting will begin an investigation into Lohmeier's comments to see if they constitute prohibited partisan political activity.

ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court began Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Monday. This is the start of a four-day hearing in which Barrett will face a line of questioning from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. During the hearing, Barrett is expected to answer questions regarding her position on abortion, the role of precedent, the Affordable Care Act, and if she plans on recusing herself from litigation on the upcoming presidential election. Since Barrett is expected to have support from a majority of both the committee and the Senate, many speculate that the questioning will have little effect on the outcome of Barrett's hearing.
TITLE=> Texas Gov. Abbott Bans All Texas Businesses From Mandating Vaccinations. ARTICLE=> Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Monday issued an executive order banning any business or person in Texas from requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for employees or customers.  “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and our best defense against the virus, but should remain voluntary and never forced,” Abbott said in a statement. Abbott also urged the state legislature to pass a similar law replacing the executive order; the order states that “No entity in Texas can compel receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine by any individual, including an employee or a consumer, who objects to such vaccination for any reason of personal conscience, based on a religious belief, or for medical reasons, including prior recovery from COVID-19.”

TITLE=> National Guard Deployed and Armed to Defend Capitol Building Ahead of Biden Inauguration.

TITLE=> Bill to Avert Shutdown, Suspend Debt Ceiling Blocked By Senate Republicans. ARTICLE=> Senate Republicans on Monday voted against a motion to begin debate on a Democrat-proposed stopgap bill to avert a government shutdown and suspend the debt ceiling. The motion, which needed 60 votes to avoid a Republican filibuster, failed in a 48-50 party line vote. If Congress fails to raise or suspend the debt ceiling by mid-October, the U.S. government could default on its debts for the first time in history. Republicans stuck by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s pledge to withhold Republican support for any Democrat bill that extended the debt ceiling. McConnell argued that raising the debt ceiling would allow Democrats to spend more under their current budget reconciliation plan. Democrats refused to include a debt limit suspension in their budget reconciliation bill, which Republicans cannot filibuster. Much of the debt the government could end up defaulting on was undertaken by Republicans during the Trump presidency; the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects the national debt to rise by $3 trillion in 2021.
TITLE=> Congress Meets to Confirm Electoral College Results. ARTICLE=> As Congress meets to confirm President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election, a group of Republicans in Congress plans to object to certain states’ Electoral College votes. Political analysts from across the spectrum say the objections are highly unlikely to alter the election result, and high-ranking Republicans have voiced opposition to the move. Additionally, thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of decisive election fraud have gathered in Washington, D.C. for the Save America Rally, leading to some clashes with police Tuesday night. Trump spoke at the rally on Wednesday, saying, “Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore...We will stop the steal.”

TITLE=> Democrats Introduce Bill To Raise Minimum Wage To $15 by 2025. ARTICLE=> Democrats in the House and Senate reintroduced legislation on Tuesday that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025. If passed, the Raise the Wage Act would eventually more than double the current $7.25 federal minimum wage and tie it to median wage growth beyond 2025. While the bill passed in the House in July 2020, it is unlikely to pass in the Senate without using budget reconciliation, a process which bypasses the filibuster in certain situations. Renewed efforts to raise the minimum wage have gained strength with the support of President Joe Biden, who called for a $15 minimum wage in his COVID-19 relief proposal and issued an executive order setting the stage for a $15 minimum wage for federal government workers.

TITLE=> Study Finds Delta COVID-19 Variant Doubles Risk Of Hospitalization, Vaccine Still Effective. ARTICLE=> A Scottish study released Monday found that the Delta COVID-19 variant carries double the risk of hospitalization as the previously dominant strain in Scotland, called the Alpha strain, but that two-dose vaccines are still effective against the Delta strain. Researchers determined that the Delta strain, which originated in India, became the dominant strain in Scotland on May 19; the previous dominant strain was the Alpha strain, which originated in Kent, England. The study's findings suggested Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine was found to give 79% protection from the Delta variant, while the same vaccine provided 92% protection against the Alpha strain; Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine provided 60% protection from the Delta variant, while it gave 73% protection from the Alpha variant.

ARTICLE=> Seven Capitol Police officers filed a lawsuit Thursday alleging that former President Donald Trump, some of his supporters and right-wing extremist group leaders planed to interfere with the transition of power following the 2020 election, which purportedly led to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. The suit accuses Trump and others, including former adviser Roger Stone and the leaders of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, of violating the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. The act includes protections of an individual's constitutional rights, and outlaws conspiracies that disrupt Congress’s constitutional duties. The lawsuit alleges that Trump and his supporters attempted to use false voter fraud claims to overturn election results in regions with large black populations; five of the seven officers on the lawsuit are black.

The Trump administration previously limited Section 1557 protections to a person’s biological sex in June 2020.

TITLE=> U.S. Agrees to 'Remove Remaining Troops' From Iraq. ARTICLE=> The United States and Iraq agreed Wednesday on the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq after a third round of strategic talks between the countries, though no timetable has been set yet. Both countries issued a joint statement Wednesday that said since he mission of U.S. forces would now be focused on training Iraqi troops to fight ISIS, combat forces are no longer required. According to the Pentagon, there are currently 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq helping Iraq counter ISIS, though how many of those forces are combat troops is unclear. A statement from the State Department said Wednesday that with increasing capacity of Iraqi security forces, the mission of U.S. and coalition forces “has now transitioned to one focused on training and advisory tasks, thereby allowing for the redeployment of any remaining combat forces from Iraq.” Also on Wednesday, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said the joint statement does not represent an agreement to begin a further withdrawal of U.S. forces. Talks between the two nations began in June under the Trump administration; Wednesday was the first session with President Joe Biden.

TITLE=> Supreme Court Declines to Hear Transgender Bathroom Case. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear a case regarding a Virginia school board's policy on transgender students' bathroom use. In 2015, transgender student Gavin Grimm sued the Gloucester County school board after it banned Grimm from using the boys' restroom. The board attempted to appeal last year's ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; the ruling said transgender students are protected under Title IX , which bans sex discrimination in education. The court did not give a reason for its rejection; Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they would have taken on the case. This comes after the Supreme Court last year expanded the definition of discrimination on the basis of "sex” in the workplace to include “gender identity" and "sexual orientation." Earlier this month, the Education Department also expanded the definition of the federal sex discrimination ban to include "gender identity," citing the Supreme Court's 2020 ruling.
