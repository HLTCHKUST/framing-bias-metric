Texas, which was argued last November; a decision has yet to be announced. In November, Trump, along with several other Republican-led states, argued that the ACA (also known as Obamacare) was unconstitutional because its individual mandate, a tax which propped up the law’s constitutionality in past cases, was removed by Congress in 2017. They argued that the individual mandate was essential to the ACA and that the ACA must fall as a result.

In his dissent, Thomas acknowledged that the case wouldn't have impacted the election's outcome, but said "the decision to leave election law hidden beneath a shroud of doubt is baffling. By doing nothing, we invite further confusion and erosion of voter confidence." The decision came as the court also elected to allow the Manhattan district attorney to obtain former President Donald Trump's tax returns.

TITLE=> White House Purchases 200 Million More COVID-19 Vaccine Doses.

The administration said in January it was looking to purchase an additional 100 million doses each from Pfizer and Moderna. The additional doses bring a 50% increase in available vaccine doses, which will help the Biden administration meet the number of doses needed to cover 300 million people by the end of July. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, predicted on Thursday morning that "any American," including those outside priority categories, could begin seeking a vaccine as early as April. Though according to Biden, "we've now purchased enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all Americans," he warned that it would still be difficult to distribute the two-dose vaccines which must be spaced three to four weeks apart. Biden also criticized former President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic and the vaccine distribution.

Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) offered to add $50 billion to the GOP's $928 billion counteroffer on Friday. Biden offered to lower his initial $2.3 trillion proposal to $1 trillion Thursday, though it would still be funded by a corporate tax hike with a 15% tax floor. Republicans firmly oppose the tax hike, instead proposing that their bill be funded in part by leftover funds originally set aside for COVID-19 relief. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) told Fox News Sunday that he is still “very, very confident” a bipartisan deal can be reached.

Cuomo announced his resignation last week after the state attorney general's released an investigation saying he sexually harassed 11 women; he will step down next Tuesday. The New York State Assembly decided on Friday to suspend its impeachment investigation into Cuomo, who many still face criminal charges in connection with the harassment claims. Cuomo's administration was also scrutinized for underreporting COVID-19 related deaths in nursing homes after filling empty long-term care facility beds with positive COVID-19 patients early in the pandemic. Hochul vowed to cooperate with questions about the nursing home deaths, as well as calls from state lawmakers for her to prove she was unaware of Cuomo's alleged sexual misconduct.

According to Politico, Harris's recent announcement of her trip to the southern border left her staff "scrambling" with little time to make necessary preparations. While Flournoy was heavily criticized, two anonymous administration officials said Harris is ultimately responsible for the way her office is run. Harris's spokesperson Symone Sanders told Politico that staff should raise issues directly, and called the anonymous officials "cowards." Sanders said, "We are not making rainbows and bunnies all day. What I hear is that people have hard jobs and I’m like ‘welcome to the club.' "

TITLE=> Supreme Court Sides with Police in Qualified Immunity Cases. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that police officers in two cases were entitled to qualified immunity, a key issue for police reform advocates. No dissent was filed in either case.

The posts went viral over the past week, with conservative political commentators including Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk positing the claim on Twitter. Fact checking websites on all sides of the political spectrum noted that ActBlue acts as a nonprofit fundraising tool that serves as a conduit for donations, rather than as a collector; the company delivers funds to organizations or candidates targeted by the individual donor.

TITLE=> Supreme Court Lifts California Restrictions On At-Home Worship Gatherings. ARTICLE=> On Friday night, the Supreme Court struck down California's limits on home-based worship meetings, saying it violated constitutional rights. The court's five conservative justices agreed to lift California restrictions that apply to in-home religious gatherings, while the court's three liberals and Chief Justice John Roberts would not have done so. Currently, most of the state limits indoor social gatherings to no more than three households and require attendees to wear masks and keep a physical distance. The unsigned order from the court states, “California treats some comparable secular activities more favorably than at-home religious exercise,” referencing the state's decision to allow hair salons, retail stores, and movie theaters to reopen. Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissent joined by Justice Stephen Breyer and Justice Sonia Sotomayor that the court's decision hurts state officials' ability to address the public health emergency. The court acknowledged that California's policy on gatherings will change next week, but said the restrictions will remain in place until then and that “officials with a track record of 'moving the goalposts' retain authority to reinstate those heightened restrictions at any time.” This order comes after a series of cases in which the court barred officials from enacting some COVID-related restrictions on religious gatherings. In February, The Supreme Court ordered California to allow churches to resume indoor worship services at limited capacity.

TITLE=> Report Contradicts Fauci, Says US Funded Controversial Virus Research in China. ARTICLE=> A report this week from The Intercept (Left bias) details evidence that the U.S. funded controversial virus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in Wuhan, China. National Institutes of Health (NIH) documents obtained by The Intercept delve into "gain-of-function" research at WIV backed by a U.S. grant. Gain-of-function research involves experimenting with making viruses more pathogenic or contagious to study them more closely; the U.S. grant reportedly specified that the money shouldn't be used for gain-of-function experiments. Scientists quoted by The Intercept raised biosafety concerns about the research, while "unanimously" telling the news outlet that the research "could not have directly sparked the pandemic." The documents contradict Dr. Anthony Fauci's congressional testimony in May, in which he said the U.S. "has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology." Fauci directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is part of the NIH.

While the FBI document describes multiple conversations and phone calls, the Commission could not confidently link the Saudi men to the hijackers. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan reaffirmed on Sunday that his country has been advocating for the release of these documents for over a decade, claiming they "would completely show that there was no (Saudi) involvement." 9/11 Families United, an organization that serves thousands of families and survivors of the terrorist attacks, said in a statement that they believe the document "puts to bed any doubts about Saudi complicity in the attacks."
